2016,RTM,"review of real - time market outcomes although only a small share of the power produced in ercot is transacted in the spot market , real - time energy prices are very important because they set the expectations for prices in the day - ahead market and bilateral forward markets where most transactions occur"
2016,RTM,"unless there are barriers preventing arbitrage of the prices between the spot and forward markets , the prices in the forward market should be directly related to the prices in the spot market ( i.e"
2016,RTM,", the spot prices and forward prices should converge over the long - run )"
2016,RTM,"hence , low prices in the real - time energy market will translate to low forward prices"
2016,RTM,"likewise , price spikes in the real - time energy market will increase prices in the forward markets"
2016,RTM,this section evaluates and summarizes electricity prices in the real - time market during QQyearQQ
2016,RTM,a
2016,RTM,real - time market prices the first analysis evaluates the total cost of supplying energy to serve load in the ercot wholesale market
2016,RTM,"in addition to the costs of energy , loads incur costs associated with ancillary services and a variety of non - market based expenses referred to as “ uplift"
2016,RTM,” an average “ all - in ” price of electricity has been calculated for ercot that is intended to reflect wholesale energy costs as well as these additional costs
2016,RTM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ summarizes changes in energy prices and other market costs by showing the all - in price of electricity , which is a measure of the total cost of serving load in ercot for QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ"
2016,RTM,the ercot - wide price in this figure is the load - weighted average of the real - time market prices from all zones
2016,RTM,ancillary services costs and uplift costs are divided by real - time load to show them on a per mwh basis
2016,RTM,QQmonthdayQQ ercot developed two energy price adders that are designed to improve its real - time energy pricing when conditions or ercot takes out - of - market actions for reliability
2016,RTM,"to distinguish the effects of the energy price adders , the operating reserve demand curve adder ( operating reserve adder ) and the reliability deployment price adder ( reliability adder ) are shown separate from the energy price"
2016,RTM,the operating reserve adder was implemented in mid - QQyearlag2QQ to account for the value of reserves based on the probability of reserves falling below the minimum contingency level and the value of lost load
2016,RTM,the reliability adder was implemented in QQmonthQQ QQyearlag1QQ as a mechanism to ensure that reliability deployments do not distort the energy prices
2016,RTM,"the reliability adder is calculated using a separate price run of sced , removing any reliability unit commitments ( ruc ) or deployed load capacity and recalculating prices"
2016,RTM,"when the recalculated system lambda ( average load price ) is higher than the initial system lambda , the increment is the adder"
2016,RTM,"QQmonthdayQQ for this analysis uplift includes : reliability unit commitment settlement , operating reserve demand curve ( ordc ) settlement , revenue neutrality total , emergency energy charges , base point deviation payments , emergency response service ( ers ) settlement , black start service settlement , and block load transfer settlement"

2016,RTM,the figure above indicates that natural gas prices continued to be a primary driver of energy prices
2016,RTM,"this correlation is expected in a well - functioning , competitive market because fuel costs represent the majority of most suppliers ’ marginal production costs"
2016,RTM,"since suppliers in a competitive market have an incentive to offer supply at marginal costs and natural gas is the most widely - used fuel in ercot , changes in natural gas prices should translate to comparable changes in offer prices"
2016,RTM,"the average natural gas price in QQyearQQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu , down approximately QQmonthdayQQ percent from the QQyearlag1QQ average price of $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu"
2016,RTM,"ercot average real - time energy prices were also down QQmonthdayQQ percent , declining from $ QQmonthdayQQ in QQyearlag1QQ to $ QQmonthdayQQ in QQyearQQ"
2016,RTM,the all - in price in QQyearQQ included small contributions from ercot’s energy price adders - $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh from the operating reserve adder and $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh from the reliability adder
2016,RTM,the highest monthly average operating reserve adder occurred in QQmonthQQ ; while the highest monthly average reliability adder occurred in QQmonthQQ
2016,RTM,"finally , the other classes of costs continue to be a small portion of the all - in electricity price – ancillary services costs were $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , down from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ because of QQmonthdayQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / reductions in natural gas prices and lower ancillary service requirements"
2016,RTM,"uplift costs accounted for $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh of the all - in electricity price , similar to $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,RTM,figure QQmonthdayQQ below provides additional historic perspective on the ercot average real - time energy prices as compared to the average natural gas prices in each year from QQ1kltxlt1MQQ through QQyearQQ

2016,RTM,such relationship is consistent with expectations in ercot where natural - gas generators predominate and tend to set the marginal price
2016,RTM,"a noticeable exception occurred in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , when energy prices were affected by scarcity conditions"
2016,RTM,energy prices vary across the ercot market because of congestion costs that are incurred as power is delivered over the network
2016,RTM,figure QQmonthdayQQ shows the monthly load - weighted average prices in the four geographic ercot zones during QQyearQQ and QQyearlag1QQ
2016,RTM,these prices are calculated by weighting the real - time energy price for each interval and each zone by the total load in that interval

2016,RTM,"prior to QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , average prices in the west zone were lower than average ercot wide prices"
2016,RTM,this changed in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ when demand in the west rose because of increased oil and QQmonthdayQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / gas production activity
2016,RTM,the west zone average annual price remained higher than the ercot average until QQyearQQ when increased congestion caused by high levels of wind output in the west pushed the average prices in the west lower than other zones
2016,RTM,"additionally , transmission congestion related to power flows in houston caused that zone to exhibit the highest average prices and reduced the average prices in the north zone"

2016,RTM,"as described above , the contributions of the energy price adders were relatively small in QQyearQQ"
2016,RTM,"the first of the two adders is the operating reserve adder , which is based on the loss of load probability , considering online and offline reserve levels , multiplied by the deemed value of lost load"
2016,RTM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ shows the number of hours in which the adder affected prices , and the average price effect in these hours and all hours"

2016,RTM,"overall , the operating reserve adder contributed $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh or QQmonthdayQQ percent to the annual average real - time energy price of $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh"
2016,RTM,these results do not indicate that ordc has been ineffective or that it should be modified

2016,RTM,extreme cold in QQmonthQQ of QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and unusually hot and sustained summer temperatures led to much more frequent shortages in that year
2016,RTM,shortages in years with normal weather should be infrequent
2016,RTM,"as capacity margins fall , the frequency of shortages is likely to increase but will still vary substantially year - to - year"

2016,RTM,"as previously discussed , a strong positive correlation between higher load and higher prices is expected in a well - functioning energy market , and our analysis shows such a relationship"
2016,RTM,higher prices observed at non - peak load levels are typically due to transitory situations where there is insufficient generator ramping capability
2016,RTM,"although load levels are strong predictors of energy prices , an even more important predictor is the level of operating reserves"
2016,RTM,"simply put , operating reserves are the difference between the total capacity of operating resources and the current load level"
2016,RTM,"as load level increases against a fixed quantity of operating capacity , the amount of operating reserves diminishes"
2016,RTM,"the minimum required operating reserves prior to ercot declaring energy emergency alert ( eea ) level QQmonthdayQQ is QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQmonthdayQQ / 2,300 mw"
2016,RTM,"as the available operating reserves approach the minimum required amount , energy prices should rise toward the system - wide offer cap to reflect the degradation in system reliability and the associated value of loss of load"

2016,RTM,this figure shows a strong correlation between diminishing operating reserves and rising prices
2016,RTM,"operating reserves did get within QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw of the minimum required level on one day in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ , but remained just above the level at which ercot would declare eea level QQmonthdayQQ"
2016,RTM,"in contrast , there were numerous dispatch intervals in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ when the minimum operating reserve level was approached or breached , and prices reached the system - wide offer cap in QQmonthdayQQ hours"
2016,RTM,concerns have been expressed that real - time prices were not higher during the infrequent intervals of low operating reserves in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearQQ
2016,RTM,a review of the ordc parameters was undertaken in response to those concerns
2016,RTM,there also have been changes to the reserve discount factor and how non - frequency responsive capacity is counted as reserve capacity
2016,RTM,"these changes , along with capacity additions and changes to the ancillary services requirements have all had an impact , some countervailing , on the levels of physical responsive capacity available during QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearQQ"
2016,RTM,"prices in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ , even at lower operating reserve levels were set by generator offers"

2016,DAM,"offers to sell can take the form of either a three - part supply offer , which allows sellers to reflect the unique financial and operational characteristics of a specific generation resource , or an energy - only offer , which is location specific but is not associated with a generation resource"
2016,DAM,bids to buy are also location specific
2016,DAM,"in addition to the purchase and sale of power , the day - ahead market also includes ancillary services and point - to - point ( ptp ) obligations"
2016,DAM,ptp obligations allow parties to hedge the incremental cost of congestion between day - ahead and real - time operations
2016,DAM,"with the exception of the acquisition of ancillary service capacity , the day - ahead market is a financial market"
2016,DAM,"although all bids and offers are evaluated for the ability to reliably flow on the transmission network , there are no operational obligations resulting from the day - ahead market"
2016,DAM,"day - ahead transactions are made for a variety of reasons , including satisfying the participant’s own demand , managing risk by hedging the participant’s exposure to real - time prices or congestion , or arbitraging with the real - time prices"
2016,DAM,"for example , load - serving entities can insure against volatility in the real - time market by purchasing in the day - ahead market"

2016,DAM,this section concludes with a review of the ancillary service markets
2016,DAM,a
2016,DAM,day - ahead market prices one indicator of market performance is the extent to which forward and real - time spot prices converge over time
2016,DAM,forward prices will converge with real - time prices when : ( QQmonthdayQQ ) there are low barriers to shifting purchases and sales between the forward and real - time markets ; and ( QQmonthdayQQ ) sufficient information is available to market participants to allow them to develop accurate expectations of future real - time prices
2016,DAM,"when these conditions are met , market participants can be expected to arbitrage predictable differences between forward prices and real - time spot prices by increasing net purchases in the lower priced market and increasing net sales in the higher priced market"
2016,DAM,"this improves the convergence of forward and real - time prices , which should lead to improved commitment of resources needed to satisfy the system’s real - time needs"
2016,DAM,"in this subsection , price convergence between the day - ahead and real - time markets is evaluated"
2016,DAM,"this average price difference reveals whether persistent and predictable differences exist between day - ahead and real - time prices , which participants should arbitrage over the long term"
2016,DAM,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQmonthdayQQ / to measure the short - term deviations between real - time and day - ahead prices , the average of the absolute value of the difference between the day - ahead and real - time price are calculated on a daily basis"
2016,DAM,"this measure captures the volatility of the daily price differences , which QQmonthQQ be large even if the day - ahead and real - time energy prices are the same on average"
2016,DAM,"QQmonthdayQQ figure QQmonthdayQQ summarizes the price convergence between the day - ahead and real - time markets , by month in QQyearQQ"
2016,DAM,price convergence was good in QQyearQQ
2016,DAM,day - ahead prices averaged $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearQQ compared to an average real - time price of $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh
2016,DAM,QQmonthdayQQ this day - ahead premium is consistent with expectations due to the much higher volatility of real - time prices
2016,DAM,risk is lower for loads purchasing in the day - ahead market and higher for generators selling day ahead
2016,DAM,the higher risk for generators is associated with the potential of incurring a forced outage and having to buy back energy at real - time prices
2016,DAM,this explains why the highest premiums occurred during the summer months in QQyearQQ with the highest relative demand and highest prices

2016,DAM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ below shows that the volume of day - ahead purchases provided through a combination of generator - specific and virtual energy offers was approximately QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent of real - time load in QQyearQQ , which was a slight increase compared to QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent in QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,DAM,"although it QQmonthQQ appear that many loads are subjecting themselves to greater risk by not locking in a day - ahead price , other transactions are being used for this purpose"
2016,DAM,point to point ( ptp ) obligations are financial transactions purchased in the day - ahead market

2016,DAM,point - to - point obligations purchases of ptp obligations comprise a significant portion of day - ahead market activity
2016,DAM,"they are similar to , and can be used to complement , congestion revenue rights ( crrs )"
2016,DAM,"crrs , as more fully described in section iii : transmission congestion and congestion revenue rights , are acquired via monthly and annual auctions and allocations"
2016,DAM,crrs accrue value to their owner based on locational price differences as determined by the day - ahead market
2016,DAM,participants buy ptp obligations by paying the difference in prices between two locations in the day - ahead market
2016,DAM,they receive the difference in prices between the same two locations in the real - time market
2016,DAM,"hence , a participant that owns a crr can use its crr proceeds from the day - ahead market to buy a ptp obligation between the same two points in order to transfer its hedge to real time"

2016,DAM,"this indicates that , in aggregate , buyers of ptp obligation profited from the transactions"
2016,DAM,this occurs when real - time congestion is greater than day - ahead market congestion
2016,DAM,"across the year , and in ten of twelve months , the acquisition charges were less than the revenues received , implying that expectations of congestion as evidenced by day - ahead purchases were less than the actual congestion that occurred in real - time"
2016,DAM,"during QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ these expectations were reversed , as congestion anticipated in the day - ahead market did not materialize in real time"
2016,DAM,the payments made to ptp obligation owners come from real - time congestion rent

2016,DAM,"for all ptp obligations that source at a generator location , the capacity up to the actual generator output is considered to be hedging the real - time congestion associated with generating at that location"
2016,DAM,the figure above shows that this comprised most of the volume of ptp obligations purchased
2016,DAM,the remaining volumes of ptp obligations are not directly linked to a physical position and are assumed to be purchased primarily to arbitrage anticipated price differences between two locations

2016,DAM,"ancillary services market the primary ancillary services are up regulation , down regulation , responsive reserves , and non - spinning reserves"
2016,DAM,market participants QQmonthQQ self - schedule ancillary services or purchase them through the ercot markets
2016,DAM,"in general , the purpose of responsive and non - spinning reserves is to protect the system against unforeseen contingencies ( e.g"
2016,DAM,", unplanned generator outages , load forecast error , wind forecast error ) , rather than for meeting normal load fluctuations"
2016,DAM,"ercot procures responsive reserves to ensure that the system frequency can quickly be restored to appropriate levels after a sudden , unplanned outage of generation capacity"
2016,DAM,"non - spinning reserves are provided from slower responding generation capacity , and can be deployed alone , or to restore responsive reserve capacity"
2016,DAM,"regulation reserves are capacity that responds every four seconds , either increasing or decreasing as necessary to fill the gap between energy deployments and actual system load"
2016,DAM,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / since QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag1QQ , ercot has calculated the requirement for responsive reserves based on a variable hourly need"
2016,DAM,this requirement is determined and posted in advance for the year
2016,DAM,ercot procures non - spinning reserves such that the combination of non - spinning reserves and regulation up will cover QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent of the calculated net load forecast error
2016,DAM,ercot will always procure a minimum quantity of non - spinning reserves greater than or equal to the largest generation unit
2016,DAM,total requirements for ancillary services declined in QQyearQQ
2016,DAM,"the average total requirement in QQyearQQ was approximately 4,900 mw , a reduction from the average total requirement of 5,300 mw in QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,DAM,"the reduction was spread fairly evenly across non - spinning reserves , and regulation up and down"
2016,DAM,"although the megawatt reduction was spread fairly evenly across these three services , the percentage reduction was much larger for the regulation services ( QQmonthdayQQ percent ) than non - spinning ( QQmonthdayQQ percent )"

2016,DAM,this means that market participants need not include expectations of forgone energy sales in ancillary service capacity offers
2016,DAM,"because ancillary service clearing prices explicitly account for the opportunity costs of selling energy in the day - ahead market , ancillary service prices should generally be correlated with day - ahead energy prices"
2016,DAM,this correlation was not as obvious in QQyearQQ as other factors contributed to changes in ancillary service prices
2016,DAM,"monthly average prices for responsive reserve varied from $ QQmonthdayQQ to $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , with the most expensive month being QQmonthQQ"
2016,DAM,one possible explanation is that high wind generation led to changes in unit commitment patterns and less online capacity capable of providing reserves
2016,DAM,figure QQltxlt100QQ below presents the average clearing prices of capacity for the four ancillary services
2016,DAM,the absence of meaningful occurrences of scarcity conditions in QQyearQQ resulted in relatively small variation in average energy prices and correspondingly stable ancillary service prices

2016,DAM,"when ercot experiences a shortage of operating reserves , real - time prices will rise to reflect the expected value of lost load embedded in the ordc mechanism"
2016,DAM,the expectation of higher real - time prices will tend to drive up the day - ahead price for ancillary QQltxlt100QQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / services
2016,DAM,"hence , the lack of shortages contributed to the low average ancillary service prices shown in the table"
2016,DAM,"in contrast to the individual ancillary service prices , figure QQltxlt100QQ shows the monthly total ancillary service costs per mwh of ercot load and the average real - time energy price for QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ"
2016,DAM,"with no meaningful occurrences of scarcity conditions in QQyearQQ , the total cost for ancillary services was relatively low during summer months"

2016,DAM,"since the initial consideration of ercot’s nodal market design , the imm has been recommending that ercot implement real - time co - optimization of energy and ancillary services because of this improved efficiency"
2016,DAM,the ercot market appropriately reflects the tradeoff between providing capacity for ancillary services versus providing energy in its co - optimized day - ahead market
2016,DAM,"those same tradeoffs exist in real time and without comprehensive , market - wide co - optimization , the ercot market will continue to be subject to the choices of individual qses"

2016,DAM,a sasm QQmonthQQ also be opened if ercot changes its ancillary service plan ; this did not occur during QQyearQQ
2016,DAM,ercot executed a sasm for QQ100ltxlt1kQQ hours in QQyearQQ
2016,DAM,"this was slightly more frequent than in QQyearlag1QQ , but still less than one percent of the time"
2016,DAM,"the frequency of sasms continues to be very low , declining from seven percent in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , three percent in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , and two percent in QQyearlag2QQ"
2016,DAM,"the final analysis in this section , shown in figure QQltxlt100QQ , summarizes the average quantity of each service that was procured via sasm"
2016,DAM,identical data is shown on two different scales because of the very large sasm procurement of non - spinning reserves in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ
2016,DAM,the opportunity exists for market participants to use the sasm process as a re - configuration market
2016,DAM,that is to move into or out of ancillary service positions awarded day ahead
2016,DAM,"sasms were infrequent largely because of the dearth of ancillary service offers typically available throughout the operating day , limiting re - configuration opportunities"
2016,DAM,"the sasm procurement method , while offer based , is inefficient and problematic"
2016,DAM,"because ancillary services are not co - optimized with energy in the sasm , potential suppliers are required to estimate opportunity costs rather than have the auction engine calculate it directly , which leads to resources that underestimate opportunity costs being inefficiently preferred over resources that overestimate opportunity costs"
2016,DAM,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / figure QQltxlt100QQ : ancillary service quantities procured in sasm 2,500 responsive reserve nonspin reserve regulation up regulation down 2,000 1,500 1,000 QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw QQxlt1QQ mw QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQxlt1QQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ further , the need to estimate the opportunity costs , which change constantly and significantly over time as the energy price changes , provides a strong disincentive to sasm participation , contributing to the observed lack of sasm offers"
2016,DAM,the paucity of sasm offers frequently leaves ercot with two choices in response to ancillary service un - deliverability or failure to provide : ( QQmonthdayQQ ) use an out - of - market ancillary service procurement action with its inherent inefficiencies ; or ( QQmonthdayQQ ) operate with a deficiency of ancillary services with its inherent increased reliability risk
2016,DAM,"real - time co - optimization of energy and ancillary services does not require resources to estimate opportunity costs , would eliminate the need for the sasm mechanism , and allow ancillary services to be continually shifted to the most efficient provider"
2016,DAM,"because co - optimization allows the real - time market far more flexibility to procure energy and ancillary services from online resources , it would also reduce ercot’s need to use ruc procedures to acquire ancillary services"
2016,DAM,"its biggest benefit would be to effectively handle situations where entities that had day - ahead ancillary service awards were unable to fulfill that commitment , e.g"
2016,DAM,due to a generator forced outage
2016,DAM,"thus , implementation of real - time co - optimization would provide benefits across the market"

2016,Congestion,iii
2016,Congestion,transmission congestion and congestion revenue rights one of the most important functions of any electricity market is to manage the flows of power on the transmission network by not allowing additional power flow on transmission facilities that have reached their operating limits
2016,Congestion,the action taken to ensure operating limits are not violated is called congestion management
2016,Congestion,the effect of congestion management is to change the output level of one or more generators to reduce the amount of electricity flowing on any transmission facility nearing its operating limit
2016,Congestion,QQmonthdayQQ this leads to higher costs as a result of necessary changes to generation output to ensure that operating limits are not violated
2016,Congestion,this increase in more expensive generation and / or decrease in less expensive generation results in different prices at different nodes
2016,Congestion,the decision about which generator ( QQmonthQQ ) will vary its output is based on the generator’s energy offer curve and how much of its output will flow across the overloaded transmission element
2016,Congestion,this leads to the dispatch of the most efficient generation to reliably serve demand while providing locational marginal pricing reflective of the actions taken to ensure system security
2016,Congestion,"the locational difference in prices produced by congestion can provide challenges to parties that have transacted in long term power contracts ; namely , if the production point ( for a seller ) or consumption point ( for a purchaser ) is different from the contracted delivery point , the party is subject to the risk that the prices will be different when settled"
2016,Congestion,"congestion revenue rights ( crr ) markets enable parties to purchase the rights to those price differences in seasonal and monthly blocks , and thus achieve some level of price certainty"
2016,Congestion,"this section of the report summarizes transmission congestion in QQyearQQ , provides a review of the costs and frequency of transmission congestion in both the day - ahead and real - time markets , and concludes with a review of the activity in the crr market"
2016,Congestion,a
2016,Congestion,"summary of congestion the total congestion costs experienced in the ercot real - time market were $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million in QQyearQQ , a QQltxlt100QQ percent increase from QQyearlag1QQ values"
2016,Congestion,"this is a substantial increase , especially given the reduction in natural gas prices that would typically reduce transmission congestion"
2016,Congestion,the increase in congestion occurred as constraints were binding in QQmonthdayQQ percent more intervals in QQyearQQ
2016,Congestion,the north and houston zones experienced an increase in price differences between the two zones and within each zone in QQyearQQ
2016,Congestion,the costs of congestion in the west and south zones in QQyearQQ were similar to QQyearlag1QQ
2016,Congestion,"QQmonthdayQQ because the transmission system is operated such that it can withstand the unexpected outage of any element at any time , congestion management actions most often occur when a transmission element is expected to be overloaded if a particular unexpected outage ( contingency ) were to occur"
2016,Congestion,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / figure QQltxlt100QQ provides a comparison of the amount of time transmission constraints were active and binding for various load levels in QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ
2016,Congestion,this figure also indicates the average number of constraints in a real - time contingency analysis ( rtca ) execution for each load level
2016,Congestion,this is the process in which the resulting flows on the transmission system are evaluated after systematically removing elements of the transmission system
2016,Congestion,"if the loss of a transmission element ( contingency ) results in a flow higher than the element rating , this is considered a thermal constraint"
2016,Congestion,binding transmission constraints are those for which the dispatch levels of generating resources are actually altered in order to maintain transmission flows at reliable levels
2016,Congestion,the costs associated with this re - dispatch are the system’s congestion value and are included in nodal prices
2016,Congestion,"active transmission constraints are those which the dispatch software evaluated , but did not require a re - dispatch of generation"

2016,Congestion,the percent of time with active constraints in QQyearQQ is very similar to QQ1kltxlt1MQQ
2016,Congestion,there was more constraint activity at nearly all load levels in QQyearQQ except for load levels below QQmonthdayQQ gw
2016,Congestion,"the most notable difference between QQyearQQ and QQyearlag1QQ is that , while rtca on average showed fewer constraints in QQyearQQ , the percentage of time with an active constraint in each load QQltxlt100QQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / level , except for the very lowest loads , was higher than QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,Congestion,this is explained by the number of sced intervals with an active generic transmission constraint ( gtc ) which increased by QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent in QQyearQQ as compared to QQyearlag1QQ
2016,Congestion,gtcs are not derived from the real - time contingency analysis but rather are based on studies performed by ercot
2016,Congestion,gtc limits are calculated by ercot the day before the operating day
2016,Congestion,a gtc indicates a requirement for sced dispatch to resolve a stability or a voltage condition
2016,Congestion,certain gtcs are monitored in real - time
2016,Congestion,"the north to houston , bakersfield , panhandle , laredo , zorillo to ajo , and valley import are analyzed in real - time using the voltage stability assessment or transient stability assessment components of ems"
2016,Congestion,using these tools to continuously evaluate these constraints in real time provides a more accurate limit than what was calculated by ercot in the day - ahead process
2016,Congestion,"actions taken to resolve a gtc QQmonthQQ also benefit other potential congestion issues , resulting in fewer thermal constraints in rtca"
2016,Congestion,this could explain the lower number of rtca constraints at certain load levels in QQyearQQ
2016,Congestion,shown below in table QQmonthdayQQ are the gtcs that were monitored in QQyearQQ
2016,Congestion,"the highlighted gtc , molina , was removed on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ when the stability issue was resolved"

2016,Congestion,the north and houston zones experienced an increase in price impacts between and within the two zones in QQyearQQ
2016,Congestion,congestion costs for the west and south zones were very similar to QQyearlag1QQ
2016,Congestion,"most of the increased congestion was attributable to a variety of transmission outages , some of which were taken to perform system upgrades"
2016,Congestion,the completion of these upgrades is expected to reduce associated congestion
2016,Congestion,b
2016,Congestion,real - time constraints the review of real - time congestion begins with describing the congested areas with the highest financial impact
2016,Congestion,"for this discussion , a congested area is determined by consolidating multiple real - time transmission constraints that are determined to be similar due to their geographic proximity and constraint direction"
2016,Congestion,"there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unique constraints that were binding at some point during QQyearQQ with a median financial impact of approximately $ 150,000"
2016,Congestion,"in QQyearlag1QQ there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unique constraints with a median financial impact of $ 162,000"
2016,Congestion,the most expensive QQltxlt100QQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / constraints in QQyearQQ had a larger price impact than QQyearlag1QQ as evidenced by the decrease in the number of unique constraints
2016,Congestion,figure QQltxlt100QQ displays the ten most costly real - time constraints as measured by congestion value
2016,Congestion,"the north to houston constraint , comprised of the gtc and multiple thermal constraints , most notably the double circuit singleton to zenith QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines and double circuit jewett to singleton QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines , was the most congested location in QQyearQQ at $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million"

2016,Congestion,its impacts were $ QQltxlt100QQ million and occurred solely in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ
2016,Congestion,they were related to a QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv transformer replacement outage at the ph robinson generation site
2016,Congestion,"the third most congested area was the denton area , north of dallas fort worth , which includes the west denton to jim christal QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line and west denton to fort worth QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line constraints"
2016,Congestion,congestion in this area was due to outages taken to accommodate transmission and substation construction to support load growth in the denton area
2016,Congestion,"congestion due to planned and forced outages within the eagle mountain area includes the constraints of eagle mountain to morris dido QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line , morris dido to rosen heights QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line , as well as the eagle mountain QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv autotransformer # QQmonthdayQQ"
2016,Congestion,this congestion is located in the north zone and feeds dallas fort worth load from the west
2016,Congestion,the constraints in the valley area located on the east side of the lower rio grande valley and include the los fresnos to loma alta QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line ( $ QQmonthdayQQ million ) and la palma to villa cavazos QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line ( $ QQmonthdayQQ million )
2016,Congestion,these constraints were often in effect during the time that other transmission facilities in the area were taken out of service to accommodate construction of new transmission facilities
2016,Congestion,"examples of new construction include the QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines from lobo to north edinburg and north edinburg to loma alta , which were built to improve the ability to reliably serve load in the valley"
2016,Congestion,"lobo is located close to laredo , which allows a northwest feed into the valley , while the other QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line was built to help facilitate cross - valley flows"
2016,Congestion,"the newly - constructed lines also impacted the valley import gtc , reducing the congestion value by QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent from $ QQmonthdayQQ million in QQyearlag1QQ down to $ QQmonthdayQQ million in QQyearlead1QQ"
2016,Congestion,the valley import gtc was binding primarily in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ of QQyearQQ
2016,Congestion,"further affecting congestion in the valley at the end of QQyearQQ was the permanent loss of the frontera generating station in the valley , which disconnected from the ercot grid to fully interconnect with mexico"
2016,Congestion,the QQ1kltxlt1MQQ mw combined - cycle unit was built in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ with the capability for one of its gas turbines to switch grids
2016,Congestion,frontera announced its intent to fully disconnect from ercot in QQyearlag2QQ and completed the disconnection in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ
2016,Congestion,the aforementioned QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines built in the valley were built to strengthen the transmission system in anticipation of the departure of the frontera unit
2016,Congestion,the panhandle gtc was implemented in QQmonthQQ QQyearlag1QQ and had its largest impact of $ QQmonthdayQQ million in QQmonthQQ due to major QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv double - circuit line outages taken to repair tornado damage that occurred in QQmonthQQ
2016,Congestion,"by the end of QQyearQQ , there was almost 1,500 mw of wind and gas generation installed in the panhandle"
2016,Congestion,the panhandle gtc is comprised of the eight QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines from northwest texas where most of the panhandle wind interconnects
2016,Congestion,the next four constraints were due to planned outages and / or high loads in the area
2016,Congestion,the twin oak switch to jack creek QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line is located between the north and houston zones and feeds into college station
2016,Congestion,the odessa to trigas odessa tap QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line is located in the far west and incurred congestion primarily in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ
2016,Congestion,the javelina tap to molina QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line is east of laredo and experienced more frequent congestion due to wind generation installed in the area
2016,Congestion,"there is also a gtc associated with the area called molina gtc , however its congestion costs were minor"
2016,Congestion,"and lastly , the cibolo to schertz QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line is east of san antonio and incurred congestion solely in QQmonthQQ"
2016,Congestion,QQltxlt100QQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / irresolvable constraints the constraint shadow price is the value at which economic dispatch results in profit - maximizing for the generators while also meeting demand at the lowest overall production cost
2016,Congestion,"however , if the dispatch cannot resolve a reliability problem with the available generators , the shadow price would continue to increase as the economic dispatch sought a solution"
2016,Congestion,in situations where there is no generation solution the shadow price would theoretically rise to QQxgt1BQQ
2016,Congestion,"therefore , the shadow price is capped"
2016,Congestion,"shadow price caps are based on a reviewed methodology , QQmonthdayQQ and are intended to reflect the level of reduced reliability that occurs when a constraint is not able to be resolved"
2016,Congestion,"currently the shadow price caps are $ 5,000 per mw for base - case ( non - contingency ) or voltage violations , $ 4,500 per mw for QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv , $ 3,500 per mw for QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv , and $ 2,800 per mw for QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv thermal violations"
2016,Congestion,"a gtc shadow price cap is considered a voltage constraint and is set at $ 5,000 per mw"
2016,Congestion,"when a constraint becomes irresolvable , chronically reaching the shadow price cap , ercot’s dispatch software cannot find a dispatch combination to reduce the flows on the transmission element ( QQmonthQQ ) of concern to a reliable operation level"
2016,Congestion,"a regional peaker net margin mechanism is used such that once local price increases accumulate to a predefined threshold due to an irresolvable constraint , the constraint’s shadow price cap would be re - evaluated"

2016,Congestion,two elements were deemed resolvable during ercot’s annual review and were removed from the list
2016,Congestion,all three irresolvable constraints located in the south load zone are located in the valley
2016,Congestion,this is the smallest annual list since the irresolvable methodology was implemented in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ
2016,Congestion,constraints that are violated in sced are noted by the flow being greater than the value of the constraint

2016,Congestion,this is the first year that the majority of the most costly day - ahead constraints were also costly real - time constraints
2016,Congestion,a contributing factor to this convergence is that ercot continually hones the constraint list to monitor which constraints should be included in the day - ahead market analysis to be consistent with market activities observed in real - time
2016,Congestion,"located northwest of houston , the hockley to betka constraint was the ninth most costly day - ahead constraint in QQyearQQ"

2016,Congestion,the total increase in day - ahead congestion costs was approximately QQltxlt100QQ percent
2016,Congestion,"the increase in north zone congestion can be explained by denton - area transmission construction , while houston import related congestion resulted in the increase in houston zone and ercot congestion"

2016,Congestion,"congestion revenue rights market congestion can be significant from an economic perspective , compelling the dispatch of higher - cost resources because power produced by lower - cost resources cannot be delivered due to transmission constraints"
2016,Congestion,this causes different clearing prices for energy at different locations

2016,Congestion,crrs QQmonthQQ be acquired in semi - annual and monthly auctions while pre - assigned congestion revenue rights ( pcrrs ) are allocated to certain participants based on their historical patterns of transmission usage
2016,Congestion,parties receiving pcrrs pay only a fraction of the auction value of a crr QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / between the same source and sink
2016,Congestion,both crrs and pcrrs entitle the holder to payments or charges corresponding to the difference in day - ahead locational prices of the source and sink

2016,Congestion,"note that this calculation , based on the binding constraint location , is similar to the calculation used earlier in this report to display the zonal location of real - time and day - ahead congestion costs and is different from the method used by ercot to determine crr revenue allocation"
2016,Congestion,the costs are broken down by the zonal location of the constraint and whether they were incurred in a monthly auction ( monthly ) or a seasonal or annual auction ( forward )

2016,Congestion,revenues from cross - zone crrs are allocated to loads ercot wide
2016,Congestion,revenues from crrs that have the source and sink in the same geographic zone are allocated to loads within that zone
2016,Congestion,"allocating crr auction revenues in this manner reduces the net cost for load purchases in heavily - congested areas , but it does so whether the congestion had raised prices in the area or lowered prices in the area"
2016,Congestion,"as a case in point , congestion lowered prices in the west zone to below the ercot average , as seen above in figure QQmonthdayQQ"
2016,Congestion,"however , because so many crrs were purchased in the west zone to capture the value of this price lowering congestion , a higher than load - ratio share portion of the crr revenue gets distributed to qses representing west zone load , thus further lowering the west zone prices"
2016,Congestion,"as previously mentioned in this section , purchasers of pcrrs are only charged a fraction of the pcrr auction value"
2016,Congestion,the difference between the auction value and the value charged to the purchaser is shown in figure QQltxlt100QQ as the pcrr discount

2016,Congestion,for the entire year of QQyearQQ participants spent $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million to procure crrs and received $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million
2016,Congestion,the next analysis of aggregated crr positions adds day - ahead congestion rent to the picture
2016,Congestion,day - ahead congestion rent is the difference between the total costs that loads pay and the total revenue that generators receive in the day - ahead market
2016,Congestion,day - ahead congestion rent creates the source of funds used to make payments to crr owners

2016,Congestion,"it is worth noting that , since the crr network model uses line ratings that are QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent of the expected lowest line ratings for the month , one would expect that crrs would be somewhat undersold and that day - ahead congestion rent would be higher than the payment to crr owners"

2016,Congestion,"while the target value is paid to crr account holders most of the time , there are two circumstances where an amount less than the target value is paid"
2016,Congestion,the first circumstance happens when the crr is modeled on the day - ahead network and causes a flow on a transmission line that exceeds the line’s limit
2016,Congestion,"in this case , crrs with a positive value that have a source and / or a sink located at a resource node settlement point are often derated , that is , paid a lower amount than the target value"
2016,Congestion,"the second circumstance occurs when there is not enough day - ahead congestion rent to pay all the crrs at target ( or derated , if applicable ) value"
2016,Congestion,"in this case , all holders of positively valued crrs receive a prorated shortfall charge such that the congestion revenue plus the shortfall QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / charge can pay all crrs at target or derated value"
2016,Congestion,"this shortfall charge has the effect of lowering the net amount paid to crr account holders ; however , if at the end of the month there is excess day - ahead congestion rent that has not been paid out to crr account holders , the excess congestion rent can be used to make whole the crr account holders that received shortfall charges"
2016,Congestion,"if there is not enough excess congestion rent from the month , the rolling crr balancing fund can be drawn upon to make whole crr account holders that received shortfall charges"

2016,Congestion,these price spreads are interesting as many loads QQmonthQQ have contracts that hedge to the hub price and are thus exposed to the price differential between the hub and its corresponding load zone
2016,Congestion,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ presents the price spreads between all hub and load zones as valued at four separate points in time – at the average of the four semi - annual crr auctions , monthly crr auction , day - ahead and real - time"
2016,Congestion,of note is the relatively poor convergence between the forward crr price spreads for the west load zone and the actual price spreads
2016,Congestion,this QQmonthQQ be due to the difficulty forecasting the price impacts of variable wind output
2016,Congestion,also noteworthy is that the south load zone has overtaken the west load zone to become the zone with the highest hub to zone price spread

2016,Supply/Demand,"specific analysis of the large quantity of installed wind generation is included , along with a discussion of the daily generation commitment characteristics"
2016,Supply/Demand,this section concludes with a discussion of demand response resources
2016,Supply/Demand,a
2016,Supply/Demand,ercot load in QQyearQQ the changes in overall load levels from year to year can be shown by tracking the changes in average load levels
2016,Supply/Demand,this metric tends to capture changes in load over a large portion of the hours during the year
2016,Supply/Demand,separately evaluating the changes in the load during the highest - demand hours of the year is also important
2016,Supply/Demand,significant changes in peak demand levels play a major role in assessing the need for new resources
2016,Supply/Demand,the level of peak demand also affects the probability and frequency of shortage conditions ( i.e
2016,Supply/Demand,", conditions where firm load is served but minimum operating reserves are not maintained )"
2016,Supply/Demand,the expectation of resource adequacy is based on the value of electric service to customers and the harm or inconvenience to customers that can result from interruptions to that service
2016,Supply/Demand,"hence , both of these dimensions of load during QQyearQQ are examined in this subsection and summarized in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,"this figure shows peak load and average load in each of the ercot geographic zones from QQyearlag2QQ to QQyearQQ in each zone , as in most electrical systems , peak demand significantly exceeds average demand"
2016,Supply/Demand,the north zone is the largest zone ( with about QQltxlt100QQ percent of the total ercot load ) ; the south and houston zones are comparable ( QQmonthdayQQ percent ) while the west zone is the smallest ( QQmonthdayQQ percent of the total ercot load )
2016,Supply/Demand,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ also shows the annual non - coincident peak load for each zone
2016,Supply/Demand,"this is the highest load that occurred in a particular zone for one hour during the year ; however , the peak can occur in different hours for different zones"
2016,Supply/Demand,"as a result , the sum of the non - coincident peaks for the zones is greater than the annual ercot peak load"
2016,Supply/Demand,"QQmonthdayQQ for purposes of this analysis , non - opt in entity ( noie ) load zones have been included with the proximate geographic zone"

2016,Supply/Demand,"as QQyearQQ was a leap year , the relative increase in the total load is higher than the increase in average load"
2016,Supply/Demand,"with the exception of the north zone , all zones showed an increase in average real - time load in QQyearQQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,houston saw the largest average load increase at QQmonthdayQQ percent
2016,Supply/Demand,changes in average loads were largely explained by summer weather
2016,Supply/Demand,"cooling degree days , a metric that is highly correlated with weather - related summer load , increased QQmonthdayQQ percent on average from QQyearlag1QQ to QQyearQQ in houston and decreased QQmonthdayQQ percent in dallas"
2016,Supply/Demand,"however , cooling degree days in QQyearQQ were still QQmonthdayQQ to QQmonthdayQQ percent lower than ercot’s hottest recent summer in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,"summer conditions in QQyearQQ also led to a new ercot - wide coincident peak hourly demand record of 71,110 mw on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,"this broke the prior year’s peak demand record of 69,877 mw that occurred on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,"in fact , demand exceeded 70,000 mw five different times in QQyearQQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,the QQyearQQ peak represents a QQmonthdayQQ percent increase from the peak hourly demand of QQyearlag1QQ
2016,Supply/Demand,the zones experienced varying changes in peak load
2016,Supply/Demand,"although the west zone had shown a prior trend of increasing load due to oil and gas production activity , that trend reversed in QQyearQQ with a decrease in west zone peak load corresponding with a decline in oil and QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / gas activity"
2016,Supply/Demand,houston also showed a decrease in peak load
2016,Supply/Demand,the south zone had the greatest increase in peak load at QQmonthdayQQ percent
2016,Supply/Demand,"to provide a more detailed analysis of load at the hourly level , figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ compares load duration curves for each year from QQyearlag2QQ to QQyearQQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,a load duration curve illustrates the number of hours ( shown on the horizontal axis ) that load exceeds a particular level ( shown on the vertical axis )
2016,Supply/Demand,"ercot has a fairly smooth load duration curve , typical of most electricity markets , with low to moderate electricity demand in most hours , and peak demand usually occurring during the late afternoon and early evening hours of days with exceptionally high temperatures"
2016,Supply/Demand,"the load duration curve in QQyearQQ is very similar to QQyearlag1QQ , with a slight increase in the hours at the highest load levels"
2016,Supply/Demand,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : load duration curve – all hours frequency of demand QQ100ltxlt1kQQ > 60gw > 50gw > 40gw QQyearlag2QQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQyearlag1QQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQyearQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ load ( gw ) QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ QQmonthdayQQ QQmonthdayQQ QQxlt1QQ 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 hours to better illustrate the differences in the highest - demand periods between years , figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ below shows the load duration curve for the QQmonthdayQQ percent of hours with the highest loads"
2016,Supply/Demand,this figure also shows that the peak load in each year is significantly greater than the load at the 95th percentile of hourly load

2016,Supply/Demand,the wind profiles in this area are such that most of the wind production occurs during off - peak hours or other times of low system demand
2016,Supply/Demand,"this profile results in only modest reductions of the net load relative to the actual load during the highest demand hours , but much larger reductions in the net load in the other hours of the year"

2016,Supply/Demand,demand response capability demand response is a term that broadly refers to actions that can be taken by end users of electricity to reduce load in response to instructions from ercot or in response to certain market or system conditions
2016,Supply/Demand,the ercot market allows participants with demand - response capability to provide energy and reserves in a manner similar to a generating resource
2016,Supply/Demand,the ercot protocols allow for loads to actively participate in the ercot - administered markets as load resources
2016,Supply/Demand,"a second way that loads QQmonthQQ participate is through ercot - dispatched reliability programs , including emergency response service and legislatively - mandated demand response programs administered by transmission providers"
2016,Supply/Demand,"additionally , loads QQmonthQQ self - dispatch by adjusting consumption in response to energy prices or by reducing consumption during specific hours to lower transmission charges"

2016,Supply/Demand,the exception is when real - time prices are expected to be high
2016,Supply/Demand,"since load resources provide capacity by reducing consumption , they have to be consuming energy to be eligible to provide the service"
2016,Supply/Demand,during periods of expected high prices the price paid for the energy can exceed the value received from providing responsive reserves
2016,Supply/Demand,reduced offer quantities observed during the spring and fall months QQmonthQQ reflect the lack of availability of load resources due to annual maintenance at some of the larger load resource facilities
2016,Supply/Demand,"ercot protocols permit load resources to provide non - spinning reserves and regulation services , but for a variety of reasons there has been minimal participation by load resources"
2016,Supply/Demand,reliability programs there are two main reliability programs in which demand can participate in ercot – emergency response service ( ers ) and transmission provider load management programs
2016,Supply/Demand,the ers program is defined by a puct rule enacted in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ setting a program budget of QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / $ QQltxlt100QQ million
2016,Supply/Demand,"QQmonthdayQQ the program was modified from a pay as bid auction to a clearing price auction in QQyearlag2QQ , providing a clearer incentive to load to submit offers based on the costs to curtail , including opportunity cost"
2016,Supply/Demand,"in QQyearQQ , the procurement for ers shifted from four time periods per contract term to six time periods per contract term"
2016,Supply/Demand,the additional time periods were created to separate the higher risk times of early morning and early evening from the overnight and weekend hours
2016,Supply/Demand,"the time and capacity - weighted average price paid for ers over the contract periods from QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ through QQmonthQQ QQyearlead1QQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , significantly higher than the average price of $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh paid for non - spinning reserves in QQyearQQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,ers was not deployed in QQyearQQ
2016,Supply/Demand,beyond ers there are slightly less than QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw of load participating in load management programs administered by transmission providers
2016,Supply/Demand,"QQmonthdayQQ energy efficiency and peak load reduction programs are required under state law and puct rule and most commonly take the form of load management , where participants allow electricity to selected appliances ( typically air conditioners ) to be curtailed"

2016,Supply/Demand,self - dispatch in addition to active participation in the ercot market and ercot - dispatched reliability programs ; loads in ercot can observe system conditions and reduce consumption accordingly
2016,Supply/Demand,this response comes in two main forms
2016,Supply/Demand,the first is by participating in programs administered by competitive retailers and / or third parties to provide shared benefits of load reduction with end - use customers
2016,Supply/Demand,the second is through actions taken to avoid the allocation of transmission costs
2016,Supply/Demand,"of these two methods , the more significant impacts are related to actions taken to avoid the allocation of transmission costs"
2016,Supply/Demand,"for decades , transmission costs have been allocated on the basis of load contribution to the highest QQmonthdayQQ - minute system demand during each of the four months from QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ"
2016,Supply/Demand,"this allocation mechanism is routinely referred to as four coincident peak , or 4cp"
2016,Supply/Demand,"by reducing demand during peak periods , load entities seek to reduce their share of transmission charges"

2016,Supply/Demand,"QQmonthdayQQ ercot estimates that QQ1kltxlt1MQQ - 1,491 mw of load were actively pursuing reduction during the 4cp intervals in QQyearQQ , an increase from the estimated response in QQyearlag1QQ load curtailment to avoid transmission charges QQmonthQQ be resulting in price distortion during peak demand periods since the response is targeting peak demand rather than responding to wholesale prices"
2016,Supply/Demand,"this was readily apparent in QQyearQQ as there were significant load curtailments corresponding to peak load days in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ when real - time prices on those days were in the range of $ QQmonthdayQQ to $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh"
2016,Supply/Demand,two recent changes in the ercot market have made advances in appropriately pricing actions taken by load in the real - time energy market
2016,Supply/Demand,"first , the initial phase of “ loads in sced ” was implemented in QQyearlag2QQ , allowing controllable loads that can respond to QQmonthdayQQ - minute dispatch instructions to specify the price at which they no longer wish to consume"
2016,Supply/Demand,"although an important first step , there are currently no loads qualified to participate in sced"

2016,Reliability,reliability commitments one of the important characteristics of any electricity market is the extent to which it results in the efficient commitment of generating resources
2016,Reliability,"under - commitment can cause apparent shortages in the real - time market and inefficiently high energy prices ; while over - commitment can result in excessive start - up costs , uplift charges , and inefficiently low energy prices"
2016,Reliability,the ercot market does not include a mandatory centralized unit commitment process
2016,Reliability,the decision to start - up or shut - down a generator is made by the market participant
2016,Reliability,"ercot’s day - ahead market outcomes help to inform these decisions , but ercot’s day - ahead market is only financially binding"
2016,Reliability,"that is , when a generator’s offer to sell is selected ( cleared ) in the day - ahead market there is no corresponding requirement to actually start that unit"
2016,Reliability,the generator will be financially responsible for providing the amount of capacity and energy cleared in the day - ahead market whether or not the unit operates
2016,Reliability,this decentralized commitment depends on clear price signals to ensure an efficient combination of units are online and available for dispatch
2016,Reliability,"ercot , in its role as reliability coordinator , has the responsibility to commit units it deems necessary to ensure the reliable operation of the grid"
2016,Reliability,"there can be gaps between what individual resources , in aggregate , view as economic commitment and what ercot views as necessary to ensure the reliability of the region"
2016,Reliability,"in the event of these gaps , ercot uses its discretion to commit additional units to ensure reliability"
2016,Reliability,"this section describes the evolution of rules and procedures regarding reliability unit commitments ( ruc ) , the outcomes of ruc commitments , and the price mitigation that occurs during ruc and local congestion"
2016,Reliability,the section concludes with a discussion of the reliability must run procurement by ercot in QQyearQQ
2016,Reliability,a
2016,Reliability,history of ruc - related protocol changes the ruc process has undergone several modifications since the nodal market began
2016,Reliability,the following changes were implemented in an effort to improve the commitment process and market outcomes associated with ruc
2016,Reliability,"in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , an offer floor was put in place for energy above the low - sustained limit ( lsl ) for units committed through ruc"
2016,Reliability,"QQmonthdayQQ initially , the ruc offer floor was set at the system - wide offer cap"
2016,Reliability,"the ruc offer floor was subsequently adjusted to $ 1,000 per mwh30 and then to the current offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh"
2016,Reliability,"QQmonthdayQQ QQmonthdayQQ nprr435 , requirements for energy offer curves in the real time sced for generation resources committed in ruc , implemented on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2016,Reliability,"QQmonthdayQQ nprr568 , real - time reserve price adder based on operating reserve demand curve , implemented on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag2QQ"
2016,Reliability,"QQmonthdayQQ nprr626 , reliability deployment price adder , partially - implemented to update the ruc offer floor on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag2QQ"
2016,Reliability,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resources committed through the ruc process receive a make - whole payment and forfeit market revenues through a “ clawback ” provision
2016,Reliability,"beginning on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag2QQ , resources committed through the ruc process could forfeit the make - whole payments and waive the clawback charges , effectively self - committing and accepting the market risks associated with that decision"
2016,Reliability,QQltxlt100QQ this buyback or “ opt - out ” mechanism for ruc requires a resource to update its current operating plan ( cop ) before the close of the adjustment period for the first hour of a ruc commitment
2016,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag1QQ , ercot automated the ruc offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh and implemented the real - time on - line reliability deployment adder ( reliability adder )"
2016,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ since that date , when a resource properly telemeters a status indicating it has been ruc committed , ercot systems automatically set the energy offer floor at $ 1,500 per mwh"
2016,Reliability,"the reliability adder , as discussed more in section i : review of real - time market outcomes , captures the impact of reliability deployments such as ruc on energy prices"
2016,Reliability,"to provide even greater flexibility to resource owners , the ruc process will soon be modified to permit the ability to opt - out of ruc instructions given after the close of the adjustment period"
2016,Reliability,nprr744 modifies the opt - out trigger to real - time telemetry status rather than the cop submittal
2016,Reliability,this nprr is expected to be implemented mid - year QQyearlead1QQ
2016,Reliability,"during QQyearQQ , approximately QQltxlt100QQ percent of ruc instructions were given after the close of the adjustment period , thereby foreclosing the opportunity for resources to self - commit the units and shoulder the market risk"
2016,Reliability,"the late ruc commitments , however , demonstrate ercot exercising restraint in waiting as long as possible for the market to respond before committing resources through ruc"
2016,Reliability,b
2016,Reliability,ruc outcomes ercot continually assesses the adequacy of market participants ’ resource commitment decisions using a reliability unit commitment ( ruc ) process that executes both on a day - ahead and hour - ahead basis
2016,Reliability,"additional resources QQmonthQQ be determined to be needed for two reasons – to satisfy the total forecasted demand , or to make a specific generator available resolve a transmission constraint"
2016,Reliability,the constraint QQmonthQQ be either a thermal limit or a voltage concern
2016,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ nprr416 , creation of the ruc resource buyback provision ( formerly “ removal of the ruc clawback charge for resources other than rmr units ” ) , as modified by nprr575 , clarification of the ruc resource buy - back provision for ancillary services"
2016,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ note that the process for electing to opt - out of a ruc will be based on real - time telemetry when nprr744 , ruc trigger for the reliability deployment price adder and alignment with ruc settlement , goes into effect in mid - QQyearlead1QQ"
2016,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ see nprr626 , reliability deployment price adder ( formerly “ ordc price reversal mitigation enhancements ” )"
2016,Reliability,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / a unit that receives a ruc instruction is guaranteed payment of its start - up and minimum energy costs ( ruc make - whole payment )
2016,Reliability,"however , if the energy payments received by a unit operating under a ruc instruction exceed that unit’s costs , payment to that unit is reduced ( ruc clawback charge )"
2016,Reliability,"beginning in QQmonthQQ QQyearlag2QQ , a unit receiving a ruc instructions had the choice to “ opt out , ” meaning it would forgo all ruc make - whole payments in return for not being subject to ruc clawback charges"
2016,Reliability,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows how frequently these reliability unit commitments have occurred over the past three years , measured in unit - hours"

2016,Reliability,"although the total unit - hours were similar to the unit - hours in QQyearlag2QQ , they were much more consistent in QQyearQQ"
2016,Reliability,almost twelve percent of hours in QQyearQQ had at least one unit receiving a reliability unit commitment instruction
2016,Reliability,"the reliability commitments in QQyearQQ were primarily made to manage transmission constraints ( QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent of unit - hours ) , most of which were made to manage persistent congestion in the houston area and in the rio grande valley"
2016,Reliability,the ruc activity in QQyearlag2QQ was concentrated during cold weather events in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ and in response to transmission outages in QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ
2016,Reliability,"in QQyearlag1QQ , ruc commitments were most frequent in the fall due to congestion in dallas and the rio grande valley"
2016,Reliability,"during QQyearQQ , qse telemetry of ruc status served as the trigger for calculating a reliability adder"
2016,Reliability,there were QQ1kltxlt1MQQ hours in which units were settled as ruc in QQyearQQ and less than QQ100ltxlt1kQQ cumulative hours of pricing intervals with non - zero reliability adders that occurred coincident with a settled ruc hour
2016,Reliability,table QQmonthdayQQ provides the units most frequently called upon for ruc
2016,Reliability,"also provided are the hours of ruc instruction , the number of hours in which the unit opted - out , and the average low - sustained limit ( lsl ) for the unit"

2016,Reliability,"the majority of the ruc commitments were to resolve localized thermal transmission constraints ( QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent ) , and of those the majority were to units located in the houston area ( QQltxlt100QQ percent ) and in the rio grande valley ( QQmonthdayQQ percent )"
2016,Reliability,there were QQltxlt100QQ unit - hour commitments ( QQmonthdayQQ percent ) for system - wide capacity requirements
2016,Reliability,there were no commitments for voltage in QQyearQQ
2016,Reliability,"comparing QQyearQQ to QQyearlag1QQ shows the same percent of ruc QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / commitments for system - wide capacity at QQmonthdayQQ percent ; however , the total hours for system - wide capacity were significantly less in QQyearlag1QQ at only QQmonthdayQQ unit - hours"
2016,Reliability,"the next analysis compares the average dispatched output of the reliability - committed units , including those that opted - out , with the operational limits of the units"
2016,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows that the quantity of reliability unit commitment generation increased in QQyearQQ compared to the prior two years
2016,Reliability,"this figure shows that the average quantity dispatched for QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ exceeded QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw , and in QQmonthQQ exceeded QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw"
2016,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : reliability unit commitment capacity units committed for ruc in QQyearQQ showed a significant increase in the dispatch level compared to prior years
2016,Reliability,"in twelve percent of intervals with ruc - committed resources , one or more resources were dispatched above their low dispatchable limit ( ldl ) , whereas in prior years , resources receiving ruc commitments were infrequently dispatched above ldl"
2016,Reliability,"nonetheless , the higher dispatch levels in QQyearQQ were rarely dispatched at the $ 1,500 per mwh offer floor because the commitments to address localized congestion were frequently mitigated"
2016,Reliability,"when a unit is committed for ruc , the unit will receive a make - whole payment if the real - time revenues are less than the costs incurred to commit the unit"
2016,Reliability,these costs can be based on generic QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / values or unit - specific verifiable costs
2016,Reliability,approximately QQltxlt100QQ percent of resources in ercot have unit - specific verifiable costs
2016,Reliability,"of the QQ100ltxlt1kQQ different resources that received a ruc instruction in QQyearQQ , QQ100ltxlt1kQQ resources had approved unit - specific verifiable costs for start - up costs and minimum load costs"
2016,Reliability,those QQ100ltxlt1kQQ resources represent QQ100ltxlt1kQQ percent of total ruc - instructed megawatt - hours in QQyearQQ
2016,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ displays the total amount of make - whole payments and clawback charges attributable to reliability unit commitments annually for QQyearlag2QQ - QQyearQQ
2016,Reliability,units that are ruc committed are guaranteed to be paid start - up and minimum energy costs
2016,Reliability,"to the extent that the real - time energy market does not provide sufficient revenue to cover these costs , ruc - committed resources will receive a make - whole payment"
2016,Reliability,there are two sources of funding for ruc make - whole payments
2016,Reliability,the first is from qses that do not provide enough capacity to meet their obligations
2016,Reliability,"if there are remaining ruc make - whole funds required after contributions from any capacity short qses , any remaining ruc make - whole funding will be uplifted to all qses on a load - ratio share"

2016,Reliability,"during QQyearQQ , the make - whole and clawback amounts were nearly equal , with only slightly higher clawback charges"
2016,Reliability,the source of funds for all ruc make - whole payments in QQyearQQ were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / from qses that were capacity short
2016,Reliability,there was no general uplift to loads for ruc make - whole payments in QQyearQQ
2016,Reliability,the magnitude of both the clawback and make - whole amounts are very small in the scheme of the overall ercot real - time energy market
2016,Reliability,one of the important characteristics of any electricity market is the extent to which it results in the efficient commitment of generating resources
2016,Reliability,"under - commitment can cause apparent shortages in the real - time market and inefficiently high energy prices ; while over - commitment can result in excessive start - up costs , uplift charges , and inefficiently low energy prices"
2016,Reliability,"the following figure compares the amount of on - line reserves , by hour , for the summer months of QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ in QQyearQQ and QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,Reliability,the amount of on - line reserves is equal to the amount of capacity committed in excess of expected demand
2016,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ displays available online reserves by operating hour and shows the expected pattern of declining reserves as system load increases during peak demand hours
2016,Reliability,"in QQyearQQ , the average online reserves were greater than in QQyearlag1QQ for hours ending QQmonthdayQQ through QQmonthdayQQ ; in all other hours , the average online reserves were less than QQyearlag1QQ"

2016,Reliability,"however , despite higher load levels during peak hours QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / in QQyearQQ , average on - line summer reserves levels during peak hours were greater than in QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,Reliability,lower energy prices are expected during periods of higher reserves
2016,Reliability,"for a different look at self - commitment during the summer of QQyearQQ , figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the average difference between the actual online unit capacity in the peak hour and the amount of capacity committed for the peak hour by the online units for each of the QQmonthdayQQ hours leading up to the close of the adjustment period"
2016,Reliability,"this data is for hour ending QQmonthdayQQ , averaged over the months of QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ for QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearQQ"
2016,Reliability,"as can be seen from this chart , the amount of capacity committed in advance of the operating hour was less in QQyearQQ than QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,Reliability,"in QQyearlag1QQ about QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw of capacity , on average , was committed in the last hour before real time"
2016,Reliability,"in QQyearQQ , the amount increased to over QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw , with even larger deficiencies seen in the last hours leading up to real time"
2016,Reliability,"from an ercot operator perspective , the self - commitment by market participants appears deficient and QQmonthQQ be a potential contributor to the increased ruc activity in QQyearQQ"

2016,Reliability,"combined - cycle generators are comprised of multiple individual units , gas turbines and steam turbines that QQmonthQQ be operated in various combinations"
2016,Reliability,"these different combinations , or configurations , have different operating characteristics and costs reflected in ercot systems"
2016,Reliability,a common type of combined - cycle unit in ercot is QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / comprised of two gas turbines and one steam turbine
2016,Reliability,"when the resource operates in a configuration with only one gas turbine and the steam turbine , ercot’s ruc software does not recognize the additional capacity available from the second gas turbine"
2016,Reliability,"this inability of the ruc software to evaluate changes to combined - cycle configurations QQmonthQQ lead to situations where other , potentially more costly units receive ruc instructions to come online"
2016,Reliability,a preliminary analysis was performed to quantify the amount of additional capacity available from combined - cycle units that had self - committed in a configuration less than the unit’s largest capacity configuration
2016,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ below displays the additional combined cycle megawatts located in houston that could have been made available to ruc during the hours that at least one unit in houston received a ruc instruction

2016,Reliability,"in addition , market participants would be required to provide significantly more detailed information on combined - cycle configurations"
2016,Reliability,"given the relatively low overall cost to the QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / market for ruc make - whole payments , implementing such a change QQmonthQQ not be cost effective"
2016,Reliability,"however , the data indicates a sizable amount of incremental capacity is available"
2016,Reliability,c
2016,Reliability,"mitigation in situations where competitive forces are not sufficient , it can be necessary to mitigate prices to a level that approximates competitive outcomes"
2016,Reliability,ercot’s real - time market includes a mechanism to mitigate prices for resources that are required to resolve a transmission constraint
2016,Reliability,mitigation applies whether the unit is self - committed or ruc committed
2016,Reliability,"units are typically ruc committed to resolve transmission constraints and as such they are typically required to resolve a transmission constraint , and therefore mitigated"
2016,Reliability,"as shown previously in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ , it was more common for ruc - committed units to be dispatched above their low operating limits in QQyearQQ"
2016,Reliability,"this higher dispatch was due to the ruc - committed units being dispatched based on their mitigated price , not the ruc offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh"
2016,Reliability,"ercot’s dispatch software includes an automatic , two - step price mitigation process"
2016,Reliability,"in the first step , the dispatch software calculates output levels ( base points ) and associated locational marginal prices using the participants ’ offer curves and considers only the transmission constraints that have been deemed competitive"
2016,Reliability,"these “ reference prices ” at each generator location are compared with that generator’s mitigated offer cap , and the higher of the two is used to formulate the offer curve to be used for that generator in the second step in the dispatch process"
2016,Reliability,"the resulting mitigated offer curve is used by the dispatch software to determine the final output levels for each generator , taking all transmission constraints into consideration"
2016,Reliability,this approach is intended to limit the ability of a generator to raise prices in the event of a transmission constraint that requires its output to resolve
2016,Reliability,in this subsection the quantity of mitigated capacity in QQyearQQ is analyzed
2016,Reliability,"although executing all the time , the automatic price mitigation aspect of the two - step dispatch process only has the potential to have an effect when a non - competitive transmission constraint is active"
2016,Reliability,"with the introduction of an impact test in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ to determine whether units are relieving or contributing to a transmission constraint , only the relieving units are now subject to mitigation"

2016,Reliability,for the first time since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ ercot determined that there was a reliability need that warranted putting a unit under a reliability must run ( rmr ) contract
2016,Reliability,greens bayou QQmonthdayQQ is a QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw natural gas steam unit built in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and located in houston

2016,Reliability,"prior to greens bayou QQmonthdayQQ , the last time units in the ercot market were under rmr agreements was in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ – a year of extreme heat and drought"
2016,Reliability,"that year , ercot required four units that had previously been allowed to enter mothball status to return to service under rmr contracts for the peak summer demand"
2016,Reliability,the protocols were changed shortly thereafter to require that any energy from rmr units be offered at the system - wide offer cap
2016,Reliability,QQltxlt100QQ pricing out of market energy at the system - wide offer cap ensures that energy from rmr units is dispatched last
2016,Reliability,"the greens bayou QQmonthdayQQ rmr presented a different pricing issue , since it was procured to resolve a transmission constraint"
2016,Reliability,"the houston import constraint is frequently a non - competitive constraint , and hence , the price of energy from the rmr unit would be mitigated"
2016,Reliability,"given the unit’s significant helping impact on the constraint and the relatively low mitigated price , it was likely that if the unit was committed it would be dispatched before other similarly - priced or even lower - priced units in the houston area"
2016,Reliability,"nprr784 was proposed to address mitigated offer caps for rmr units , but market participants could not reach consensus on this approach and the protocol change request was not approved"
2016,Reliability,"thus , any future rmr units could still be dispatched at a mitigated price that is not reflective of the reliability value of the resource"
2016,Reliability,the greens bayou QQmonthdayQQ rmr drew significant scrutiny from market participants on the rmr process
2016,Reliability,"in addition to nprr784 , there were other protocol changes put in place as a result of the rmr contract"

2016,Resource Adequacy,resource adequacy one of the primary functions of the wholesale electricity market is to provide economic signals that will facilitate the investment needed to maintain a set of resources that are adequate to satisfy system demands and reliability needs
2016,Resource Adequacy,this section begins with an evaluation of these economic signals by estimating the “ net revenue ” resources received from ercot real - time and ancillary services markets and providing comparisons to other markets
2016,Resource Adequacy,"next , the effectiveness of the scarcity pricing mechanism is reviewed"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the current estimate of planning reserve margins for ercot and other regions are presented , followed by a description of the factors necessary to ensure resource adequacy in an energy - only market design"
2016,Resource Adequacy,a
2016,Resource Adequacy,net revenue analysis net revenue is calculated by determining the total revenue that could have been earned by a generating unit less its variable production costs
2016,Resource Adequacy,"put another way , it is the revenue in excess of short - run operating costs that is available to recover a unit’s fixed and capital costs , including a return on the investment"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in ercot’s energy - only market , the net revenues from the real - time energy and ancillary services markets alone provide the economic signals that inform suppliers ’ decisions to invest in new generation or retire existing generation"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"to the extent that revenues are available through the day - ahead market or other forward bilateral contract markets , these revenues are ultimately derived from the expected real - time energy and ancillary service prices"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"although most suppliers are likely to receive the bulk of their revenues through bilateral contracts , the spot prices produced in the real - time energy market should drive bilateral energy prices over time and thus are appropriate to use for this evaluation"
2016,Resource Adequacy,it is important to note that this net revenue calculation is a look back at the estimated contribution based on actual market outcomes
2016,Resource Adequacy,suppliers will typically base investment decisions on expectations of future electricity prices
2016,Resource Adequacy,"although expectations of future prices should be informed by history , they will also factor in the likelihood of shortage pricing conditions that could be very different than what actually occurred"
2016,Resource Adequacy,the energy net revenues are computed based on the generation - weighted settlement point prices from the real - time energy market
2016,Resource Adequacy,"weighting the energy values in this way facilitates comparisons between geographic zones , but will mask what could be very high values for a specific generator location"
2016,Resource Adequacy,this analysis does not consider any payments for potential reliability unit commitment actions
2016,Resource Adequacy,the analysis necessitates reliance on simplifying assumptions that can lead to over - estimates of the profitability of operating in the wholesale market
2016,Resource Adequacy,start - up costs and minimum running times are not accounted for in the net revenue analysis
2016,Resource Adequacy,"ramping restrictions , which can prevent generators from profiting during brief price spikes , are also excluded"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"but despite these limitations , the net revenue analysis provides a useful summary of signals for investment in the wholesale market"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / for purposes of this analysis , the following assumptions were used for natural gas units : heat rates of QQmonthdayQQ mmbtu per mwh for a combined cycle unit , QQmonthdayQQ mmbtu per mwh for a combustion turbine , and $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in variable operating and maintenance costs"
2016,Resource Adequacy,a total outage rate ( planned and forced ) of QQmonthdayQQ percent was assumed for each technology
2016,Resource Adequacy,net revenue is calculated by assuming the unit will produce energy in any hour for which it is profitable and by assuming it will be available to sell reserves and regulation ( combined cycle units only ) in all other hours
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the next two figures provide an historical perspective of the net revenues available to support investment in a new natural gas combustion turbine ( figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ) and combined cycle generation ( figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ) , selected to represent the marginal new supply that QQmonthQQ enter when new resources are needed"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the figure also shows the estimated “ cost of new entry , ” which represents the revenues needed to break even on the investment"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : combustion turbine net revenues based on estimates of investment costs for new units , the net revenue required to satisfy the annual fixed costs ( including capital carrying costs ) of a new gas turbine unit ranges from $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the net revenue in QQyearQQ for a new gas turbine was calculated to be approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ to QQltxlt100QQ per kw - year , depending on the zone , which are well below the estimated cost of new gas turbine generation"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : combined cycle net revenues for a new combined cycle gas unit , the estimate of net revenue requirement is approximately $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the net revenue in QQyearQQ for a new combined cycle unit was calculated to be approximately $ QQltxlt100QQ to QQltxlt100QQ per kw - year , depending on the zone"
2016,Resource Adequacy,these values are well below the estimated cost of new combined cycle generation
2016,Resource Adequacy,"these results are consistent with the current surplus capacity , which contributed to infrequent shortages in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearQQ"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in an energy only market , shortages play a key role in delivering the net revenues an investor would need to recover its investment"
2016,Resource Adequacy,such shortages will tend to be clustered in years with unusually high load and / or poor generator availability
2016,Resource Adequacy,"hence , these results alone do not raise substantial concern regarding design or operation of ercots ordc mechanism for pricing shortages"
2016,Resource Adequacy,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / table QQmonthdayQQ displays the calculated output - weighted price by generation type
2016,Resource Adequacy,"table QQmonthdayQQ : settlement point price by fuel type output - weighted generation type price combined - cycle > QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw $ QQmonthdayQQ combined - cycle < = QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw $ QQmonthdayQQ coal and lignite $ QQmonthdayQQ diesel $ QQltxlt100QQ gas steam non - reheat $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ gas steam reheat boiler $ QQltxlt100QQ gas steam supercritical boiler $ QQltxlt100QQ hydro $ QQmonthdayQQ nuclear $ QQmonthdayQQ photovoltaic generation resources $ QQmonthdayQQ power storage $ QQmonthdayQQ renew $ QQmonthdayQQ simple - cycle > QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw $ QQmonthdayQQ simple - cycle < = QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw $ QQltxlt100QQ wind $ QQmonthdayQQ given the very low energy prices during QQyearQQ in non - shortage hours , the economic viability of existing coal and nuclear units was evaluated"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"non - shortage prices , which have been substantially affected by the prevailing natural gas prices , determine the vast majority of net revenues received by these base load units"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"as previously described , the load - weighted ercot - wide average energy price in QQyearQQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the generation - weighted average price for the four nuclear units in ercot - approximately QQmonthdayQQ gw of capacity - was only $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearQQ , down from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"according to the nuclear energy institute ( nei ) , total operating costs for all nuclear units across the u.s"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"averaged $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearQQ , a slight decrease from the reported costs for QQyearlag1QQ assuming that operating costs in ercot are similar to the u.s"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"average , it is likely that these units were not profitable in QQyearQQ based on the fuel and operating and maintenance costs alone"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"to the extent nuclear units in ercot had any associated capital costs , it is likely those costs were not recovered"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"compared to other regions with larger amounts of nuclear generation , the four nuclear units in ercot are relatively new and owned by four entities with sizable load obligations"

2016,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / option value for the owners because they ensure that their cost of serving their load will not rise substantially if natural gas prices increase
2016,Resource Adequacy,"nonetheless , the economic pressure on these units does potentially raise a resource adequacy issue that will need to be monitored"
2016,Resource Adequacy,the generation - weighted price of all coal and lignite units in ercot during QQyearQQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh
2016,Resource Adequacy,"although specific unit costs QQmonthQQ vary , index prices for powder river basin coal delivered to ercot were approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu in QQyearQQ , a decrease from approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu in QQyearlag1QQ"
2016,Resource Adequacy,for the past two years delivered coal costs in ercot have been about $ QQxlt1QQ to $ QQxlt1QQ per mmbtu higher than natural gas prices at the houston ship channel
2016,Resource Adequacy,"given that the coal units generally have higher heat rates and more expensive non - fuel operations and maintenance costs , it follows that they have been losing market share to natural gas"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"as with nuclear units , it appears that coal units were likely not profitable in ercot during QQyearQQ"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"with the bulk of the coal fleet in ercot being more than QQmonthdayQQ years old , the retirement or suspended operation of some of these units could cause ercot’s capacity margin to fall to unreliable levels more quickly than anticipated"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"while both nuclear and coal are feeling the pressure of an increased reliance on lower - priced natural gas units , coal units appear to be at greater risk of retirement than the nuclear units in ercot"
2016,Resource Adequacy,this QQmonthQQ be due to their relative age and inefficiency
2016,Resource Adequacy,"these results indicate that during QQyearQQ the ercot markets would not have provided sufficient revenues to support profitable investment in any of the types of generation technology evaluated , which QQmonthQQ seem inconsistent with the fact that new generation continues to be added in the ercot market"
2016,Resource Adequacy,this can be explained by a number of factors
2016,Resource Adequacy,"first , resource investments are driven primarily by forward price expectations"
2016,Resource Adequacy,historical net revenue analyses do not provide a view of the future pricing expectations that will spur new investment
2016,Resource Adequacy,"suppliers will develop their own view of future expected revenue and given the level to which prices will rise under shortage conditions , small differences in expectations about the frequency of shortage pricing can greatly influence revenue expectations"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"second , this analysis does not account for bilateral contracts"
2016,Resource Adequacy,the only revenues considered in the net revenue calculation are those that came directly from the ercot real - time energy and ancillary services markets in a specific year
2016,Resource Adequacy,some developers QQmonthQQ have bilateral contracts for unit output that would provide more revenue than the ercot market did in QQyearQQ
2016,Resource Adequacy,"given the level to which prices will rise under shortage conditions , buyers QQmonthQQ enter bilateral contracts to hedge against high shortage pricing"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"third , net revenues in any one year QQmonthQQ be higher or lower than an investor would require over the long term"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in QQyearQQ , shortages were much less frequent than would be expected over the long term"
2016,Resource Adequacy,shortage revenues play a pivotal role in motivating investment in an energy - only market like ercot
2016,Resource Adequacy,"hence , in some years shortage pricing will be frequent and net revenues QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / substantially exceed the cost of entry , while in most others it will be less frequent and net revenue will be less than the cost of entry"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"finally , the costs of new entry used in this report are generic and reflective of the costs of a new unit on an undeveloped greenfield site"
2016,Resource Adequacy,they have been reduced somewhat to reflect the lower costs of construction in texas
2016,Resource Adequacy,"however , companies QQmonthQQ have opportunities to build generation at much lower cost than these estimates ; either by having access to lower cost equipment , or by adding the new unit to an existing site , or some combination of both"
2016,Resource Adequacy,financing structures and costs can vary greatly between suppliers and QQmonthQQ be improved to be lower than the generic financing costs assumed in the net revenue analysis
2016,Resource Adequacy,"to provide additional context for the net revenue results presented in this subsection , the net revenue in the ercot market for two types of natural gas generation technologies are compared with the net revenue that those technologies could expect in other wholesale markets with centrally - cleared capacity markets"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the technologies are differentiated by assumed heat rate ; 7,000 mmbtu per mwh for combined cycle and 10,500 mmbtu per mwh for simple - cycle combustion turbine"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the next two figures compare estimates of net revenue for these two types of natural gas generators for the ercot north zone , pjm , two locations within the new york iso , and the midcontinent iso"
2016,Resource Adequacy,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ provides a comparison of net revenues for a combustion turbine and figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ provides the same comparison for a combined cycle unit
2016,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : combustion turbine net revenue comparison between markets $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ capacity ancillary services $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ energy net revenue ( $ per kw ‐ year ) $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ $ QQltxlt100QQ $ ‐ nyiso ( capital ) nyiso ( capital ) nyiso ( capital ) ercot nyiso ( nyc ) ercot nyiso ( nyc ) ercot nyiso ( nyc ) pjm miso pjm miso pjm miso QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ the figures include estimates of net revenue from energy , reserves and regulation , and capacity"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"ercot does not have a capacity market , and thus , does not have any net revenue from capacity sales"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"most of the locations shown are central locations , but there are load pockets within each market where net revenue and the cost of new entry QQmonthQQ be higher"
2016,Resource Adequacy,the nyc zone of the new york iso is an example of much higher value in a load pocket

2016,Resource Adequacy,concerns with the spm under the zonal market design were addressed in every state of the market report produced during that period
2016,Resource Adequacy,"QQltxlt100QQ the implementation of the nodal market design , which included a power balance penalty curve , created the opportunity for real - time energy prices to systematically reflect the value of reduced reliability imposed under shortage conditions , regardless of submitted offers"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , the puct took another step toward improve resource adequacy signals , by directing ercot to implement the operating reserve demand curve ( ordc )"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"as discussed in section i : review of real - time market outcomes , ordc is a shortage pricing mechanism that reflects the loss of load probability at varying levels of operating reserves multiplied by the value of lost load"
2016,Resource Adequacy,in the short time it has been in effect ordc has had a small impact on real - time prices
2016,Resource Adequacy,"QQltxlt100QQ the zonal market design was not the problem per se , rather its reliance on high - priced offers to set high prices during periods of shortage was of concern"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / in QQmonthQQ , QQyearlag1QQ the puct signaled its interest in reviewing ordc “ in order to examine how it has functioned and whether there is a need for minor adjustments to improve its efficiency"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"” QQltxlt100QQ given the short time period with ordc in effect , it is difficult to evaluate whether adjustments are warranted"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"as previously discussed , shortages are generally clustered in periods when weather - dependent load is unusually high and / or generation availability is poor ; neither of which was the case in QQyearlag1QQ or QQyearQQ"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the puct has taken comment from stakeholders , but to date the puct has not directed modification of the reserve adder component of ordc"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"QQltxlt100QQ the fact that responsive and regulating reserves are forced to be maintained ( held behind the high ancillary service limit ( hasl ) ) under the current market design will continue to be problematic , regardless of the ordc parameters that are selected"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"jointly optimizing all products would improve the utilization of ercot resources , ensure that shortage pricing only occurs when the system is actually short after fully utilizing its resources , and establish prices for each product that efficiently reflect its reliability value without the use of administrative caps and adders"

2016,Resource Adequacy,"while these projections are slightly lower than those developed last year , the current outlook is very different than it was in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , when planning reserve margins were expected to be below the then - existing target level of QQmonthdayQQ percent for the foreseeable future"
2016,Resource Adequacy,QQltxlt100QQ this current projection of planning reserve margins combined with relatively infrequent shortage pricing QQmonthQQ raise doubts regarding the likelihood of announced generation coming on line as planned
2016,Resource Adequacy,"given the projections of continued low prices , investors of some of the new generation included in the report on the capacity , demand and reserves in the ercot region ( cdr ) QQmonthQQ choose to delay or even cancel their project"

2016,Resource Adequacy,these challenging fuel market economics exist regardless of the future of environmental regulations that could require additional capital investment for existing coal units
2016,Resource Adequacy,the retirement of uneconomic generation should not in any way be viewed as failure to provide resource adequacy
2016,Resource Adequacy,having the right pricing signals to encourage sufficient and efficient generation signals is the goal
2016,Resource Adequacy,most of the coal units facing the greatest price and environmental pressure have been operating for more than thirty - five years
2016,Resource Adequacy,"similar to the forces that have led to the retirement of less efficient natural gas fueled steam units , the retirement of older , less efficient coal units is an expected market outcome"

2016,Resource Adequacy,"ensuring resource adequacy one of the primary goals of an efficient and effective electricity market is to ensure that , over the long term , there is an adequate supply of resources to meet customer demand plus any required installed or planning reserves"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in a region like ercot , where customer requirements for electricity have been and are expected to continue to increase , even with growing demand response efforts , maintaining adequate supply requires capacity additions"
2016,Resource Adequacy,to incent these additions the market design must provide revenues such that the marginal resource receives revenues sufficient to make that resource economic
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in this context , “ economic ” includes both a return of and on capital investment"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"generators earn revenues from three sources : energy prices during non - shortage , energy prices during shortage and capacity payments"
2016,Resource Adequacy,the capacity payments generators receive in ercot are related to the provision of ancillary services
2016,Resource Adequacy,"ancillary service payments are a small contributor , approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ per kw - year"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"setting ancillary service payments aside , generator revenue in ercot is overwhelmingly derived from energy prices under both shortage and non - shortage conditions"
2016,Resource Adequacy,expectations for energy pricing under non - shortage conditions are the same regardless of whether payments for capacity exist
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in ercot , with no capacity payments available , the amount a generator QQmonthQQ receive from energy pricing under shortage conditions must be large enough to provide the necessary incentives for new capacity additions"
2016,Resource Adequacy,this will occur when energy prices are allowed to rise substantially during times when the available supply is insufficient to simultaneously meet both energy and minimum operating reserve requirements
2016,Resource Adequacy,"ideally , energy and reserve prices during shortages should reflect the diminished system reliability under these conditions , which is equal to the increased probability of “ losing ” load times the value of the lost load"
2016,Resource Adequacy,allowing energy prices to rise during shortages mirrors the outcome expected if loads were able to actively specify the quantity of electricity they wanted and the price they would be willing to pay
2016,Resource Adequacy,"the energy - only market design relies exclusively on QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / these relatively infrequent occurrences of high prices to provide the appropriate price signal for demand response and new investment , when required"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in this way , energy - only markets can provide price signals that will sustain a portfolio of resources to be used in real - time to satisfy the needs of the system"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"however , this portfolio QQmonthQQ not include enough capacity to meet a specified target for planning reserves"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"faced with reduced levels of generation development activity coupled with increasing loads that resulted in falling planning reserve margins , in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and QQ1kltxlt1MQQ the puct devoted considerable effort deliberating issues related to resource adequacy"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ the puct commissioners directed ercot to move forward with implementing ordc , a mechanism designed to ensure effective shortage pricing when operating reserve levels decrease"
2016,Resource Adequacy,"over the long term , a co - optimized energy and operating reserve market will provide more accurate shortage pricing"
2016,Resource Adequacy,planning reserves should continue to be monitored to determine whether shortage pricing alone is leading to the desired level of planning reserves

2016,Analysis,"analysis of competitive performance in this section , market power is evaluated from two perspectives – structural ( does market power exist ) and behavioral ( have attempts been made to exercise it )"
2016,Analysis,market structure is examined by using a pivotal supplier analysis that indicates the frequency with which a supplier was pivotal at higher load levels
2016,Analysis,this section also includes a summary of the voluntary mitigation plans in effect during QQyearQQ
2016,Analysis,market participant conduct is evaluated by reviewing measures of physical and economic withholding
2016,Analysis,these withholding patterns are further examined relative to the level of demand and the size of each supplier’s portfolio
2016,Analysis,"based on these analyses , we find the overall performance of the ercot wholesale market to be competitive in QQyearQQ"
2016,Analysis,a
2016,Analysis,structural market power indicators the market structure is analyzed by using the residual demand index ( rdi )
2016,Analysis,"the rdi is used to measure the percentage of load that cannot be served without the resources of the largest supplier , assuming that the market could call upon all committed and quick - start capacity owned by other suppliers"
2016,Analysis,"QQltxlt100QQ when the rdi is greater than zero , the largest supplier is pivotal ( i.e"
2016,Analysis,", its resources are needed to satisfy the market demand )"
2016,Analysis,"when the rdi is less than zero , no single supplier’s resources are required to serve the load if the resources of its competitors are available"
2016,Analysis,"the rdi is a useful structural indicator of potential market power , although it is important to recognize its limitations"
2016,Analysis,"as a structural indicator , it does not illuminate actual supplier behavior to indicate whether a supplier QQmonthQQ have exercised market power"
2016,Analysis,the rdi also does not indicate whether it would have been profitable for a pivotal supplier to exercise market power
2016,Analysis,"however , it does identify conditions under which a supplier could raise prices significantly by withholding resources"
2016,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the ramp - constrained rdi relative to load for all hours in QQyearQQ
2016,Analysis,the trend line indicates a strong positive relationship between load and the rdi
2016,Analysis,the analysis shown below is done at the qse level because the largest suppliers that determine the rdi values own a large majority of the resources they are offering
2016,Analysis,"to the extent that the resources scheduled by the largest qses are not controlled by or provide revenue to the qse , the rdis will tend to be slightly overstated"
2016,Analysis,"QQltxlt100QQ for the purpose of this analysis , “ quick - start ” includes off - line simple cycle gas turbines that are flagged as on - line in the current operating plan with a planned generation level of QQxlt1QQ mw that ercot has identified as capable of starting - up and reaching full output after receiving a dispatch instruction from the real - time energy market"

2016,Analysis,"this is expected because at high load levels , larger suppliers are more likely to be pivotal because other suppliers ’ resources are more fully utilized serving the load"
2016,Analysis,the frequency of relatively high loads increased in QQyearQQ
2016,Analysis,"this led to an increase in the pivotal supplier frequency to QQmonthdayQQ percent of all hours in QQyearQQ , up from QQmonthdayQQ and QQmonthdayQQ percent of all hours in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearlag2QQ , respectively"
2016,Analysis,this indicates that market power continues to be a potential concern in ercot and underscores the need for effective mitigation measures to address it
2016,Analysis,inferences regarding market power cannot be made solely from pivotal supplier data
2016,Analysis,bilateral and other financial contract obligations can affect a supplier’s potential market power
2016,Analysis,"for example , a small supplier selling energy only in the real - time energy market QQmonthQQ have a much greater incentive to exercise market power than a large supplier with substantial long - term sales contracts"
2016,Analysis,"the rdi measure shown in the previous figures do not consider the contractual position of the supplier , which can increase a supplier’s incentive to exercise market power compared to the load - adjusted capacity assumption made in this analysis"
2016,Analysis,it should be noted that the analysis above evaluates the structure of the entire ercot market
2016,Analysis,"in general , local market power in narrower areas that can become isolated by transmission constraints raise more substantial competitive concerns"
2016,Analysis,"as more fully discussed in section v , reliability commitments , this local market power is addressed through : ( a ) structural tests that QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / determine “ non - competitive ” constraints that can create local market power ; and ( b ) the application of limits on offer prices in these areas"
2016,Analysis,voluntary mitigation plans voluntary mitigation plans ( vmps ) existed for three market participants in QQyearQQ
2016,Analysis,generation owners are motivated to enter into vmps because adherence to a plan approved by the puct constitutes an absolute defense against an allegation of market power abuse through economic withholding with respect to behaviors addressed by the plan
2016,Analysis,this increased regulatory certainty afforded to a generation owner regarding its energy offers in the ercot real - time market must be balanced by appropriate protections against a potential abuse of market power in violation of pura § QQltxlt100QQ ( a ) and QQmonthdayQQ tex

2016,Analysis,"because forward energy markets are voluntary and the market rules do not inhibit arbitrage between the forward energy markets and the real - time energy market , competitive outcomes in the real - time energy market serve to discipline the potential abuse of market power in the forward energy markets"
2016,Analysis,"in QQyearQQ , there were three market participants with approved vmps – nrg , calpine , and luminant"

2016,Analysis,"in a single - price auction like the real - time energy market , suppliers QQmonthQQ attempt to exercise market power by withholding resources"
2016,Analysis,"the purpose of withholding is to cause more expensive resources to set higher market clearing prices , allowing the supplier to profit on its other sales in the real - time energy market"

2016,Analysis,"due to limitations in outage data , the outage type must be inferred"
2016,Analysis,the outage type can be inferred by cross - referencing unit status information communicated to ercot with scheduled outages
2016,Analysis,"if there is a corresponding scheduled outage , the unit is considered to be on a planned outage"
2016,Analysis,"if not , it is considered to be a forced outage"
2016,Analysis,the derated capacity is defined as the difference between the summertime maximum capacity of a generating resource and its actual capability as communicated to ercot on a continuous basis
2016,Analysis,it is very common for generating capacity to be partially derated ( e.g
2016,Analysis,", by QQmonthdayQQ to QQmonthdayQQ percent ) because the resource cannot achieve its installed capacity level due to technical or environmental factors ( e.g"
2016,Analysis,", component equipment failures or ambient temperature conditions )"
2016,Analysis,wind generators rarely produce at the installed capacity rating due to variations in available wind input
2016,Analysis,because such a large portion of derated capacity is related to wind generation it is shown separately in the following evaluation of long - term and short - term deratings
2016,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows a breakdown of total installed capacity for ercot on a daily basis during QQyearQQ
2016,Analysis,this analysis includes all in - service and switchable capacity
2016,Analysis,from the total installed capacity the following are subtracted : ( a ) capacity from private networks not available for export to the ercot grid ; ( b ) wind capacity not available due to the lack of wind input ; ( c ) short - term deratings ; ( QQmonthQQ ) short - term planned outages ; ( e ) short - term forced outages ; and ( e ) long - term outages and deratings greater than QQmonthdayQQ days
2016,Analysis,what remains is the capacity available to serve load

2016,Analysis,"short - term planned outages were largest between QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ and smallest during the summer months , which is consistent with expectations"
2016,Analysis,"short - term forced outages and deratings had no discernable seasonal pattern , occurring throughout the year"
2016,Analysis,"the quantity of long - term ( greater than QQmonthdayQQ days ) unavailable capacity , peaked in QQmonthQQ at QQmonthdayQQ gw , reduced to less than QQmonthdayQQ gw during the summer months , and increased to QQmonthdayQQ gw in QQmonthQQ"
2016,Analysis,this pattern reflects the choice by generation owners to schedule long duration outages during the spring and fall so as to ensure the units are available during the high load summer season when the units have a higher likelihood of operating
2016,Analysis,the next analysis focuses specifically on short - term planned outages and forced outages and deratings of non - wind units because these classes of outages and deratings are the most likely to be used to physically withhold units in an attempt to raise prices
2016,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the average magnitude of the outages and deratings lasting less than QQmonthdayQQ days for the year and for each month during QQyearQQ
2016,Analysis,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : short - term outages and deratings QQmonthdayQQ % deratings planned outages forced outages QQmonthdayQQ % percentage of capacity QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQxlt1QQ % QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows that total short - term deratings and outages were as large as QQmonthdayQQ percent of installed capacity in QQmonthQQ , and averaged around QQmonthdayQQ percent during the summer"
2016,Analysis,most of this fluctuation was due to anticipated planned outages
2016,Analysis,the amount of capacity unavailable during QQyearQQ averaged QQmonthdayQQ percent of installed capacity
2016,Analysis,this is a slight increase from QQmonthdayQQ percent experienced in QQyearlag1QQ and QQmonthdayQQ percent experienced in QQyearlag2QQ
2016,Analysis,"overall , the fact that outages and deratings are lowest during the summer when load is expected to be highest is consistent with expectations in a competitive market"
2016,Analysis,evaluation of potential physical withholding physical withholding occurs when a participant makes resources unavailable for dispatch that are otherwise physically capable of providing energy and that are economic at prevailing market prices
2016,Analysis,this can be done either by derating a unit or declaring it as forced out of service
2016,Analysis,"because generator deratings and forced outages are unavoidable , the goal of the analysis in this subsection is to differentiate justifiable deratings and outages from physical withholding"
2016,Analysis,physical withholding is tested for by examining deratings and outage data to ascertain whether the data are correlated with conditions under which physical withholding would likely be most profitable
2016,Analysis,the rdi results shown in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ and figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ indicate that the potential for market power abuse rises at higher load levels as the frequency of positive rdi values increases
2016,Analysis,"hence , if QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / physical withholding is occurring , one would expect to see increased deratings and outages at the highest load levels"
2016,Analysis,"conversely , because competitive prices increase as load increases , deratings and outages in a market performing competitively will tend to decrease as load approaches peak levels"
2016,Analysis,suppliers that lack market power will take actions to maximize the availability of their resources since their output is generally most profitable in peak periods
2016,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the average relationship of short - term deratings and forced outages as a percentage of total installed capacity to real - time load levels for large and small suppliers during summer months
2016,Analysis,portfolio size is important in determining whether individual suppliers have incentives to withhold available resources
2016,Analysis,"hence , the patterns of outages and deratings of large suppliers can be usefully evaluated by comparing them to the small suppliers ’ patterns"
2016,Analysis,long - term deratings are not included in this analysis because they are unlikely to constitute physical withholding given the cost of such withholding
2016,Analysis,wind and private network resources are also excluded from this analysis because of the high variation in the availability of these classes of resources
2016,Analysis,the large supplier category includes the five largest suppliers in ercot
2016,Analysis,the small supplier category includes the remaining suppliers

2016,Analysis,"since small participants have less incentive to physically withhold capacity , the outage rates for small suppliers serves as a good benchmark for competitive behavior expected from the larger suppliers"
2016,Analysis,"for large suppliers , the percent of derated capacity declined at higher load levels , whereas for small providers the percent of derated capacity was fairly constant across all load levels"
2016,Analysis,"although large providers had slightly higher forced outage rates than small providers , their level – QQmonthdayQQ percent – does not raise potential competitive concerns"
2016,Analysis,"evaluation of potential economic withholding to complement the prior analysis of physical withholding , this subsection evaluates potential economic withholding by calculating an “ output gap"
2016,Analysis,” the output gap is the quantity of energy that is not being produced by online resources even though the output is economic to produce by a substantial margin given the real - time energy price
2016,Analysis,"a participant can economically withhold resources , as measured by the output gap , by raising its energy offers so as not to be dispatched"
2016,Analysis,a resource is evaluated for inclusion in the output gap when it is committed and producing at less than full output
2016,Analysis,energy not produced from a committed resource is included in the output gap if the real - time energy price exceeds that unit’s mitigated offer cap by at least $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh
2016,Analysis,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the mitigated offer cap serves as a proxy for the marginal production cost of energy from that resource
2016,Analysis,"before presenting the results of the output gap analysis , a description of ercot’s two - step dispatch software is required"
2016,Analysis,"in the first step , the dispatch software calculates output levels ( base points ) and associated locational marginal prices using the participants ’ offer curves and only considering transmission constraints that have been deemed competitive"
2016,Analysis,"these “ reference prices ” at each generator location are compared with the generator’s mitigated offer cap , and the higher of the two is used to formulate the offer curve for that generator during the second step in the dispatch process"
2016,Analysis,"the resulting mitigated offer curve is used by the dispatch software to determine the final output levels for each generator , taking all transmission constraints into consideration"
2016,Analysis,"if a market participant has sufficient market power , it might raise its offer in such a way to increase the reference price in the first step"
2016,Analysis,"although in the second step the offer appears to be mitigated , the market participant has still influenced the market price"
2016,Analysis,this output gap is measured by the difference between the capacity level on a generator’s original offer curve at the first step reference price and the capacity level on the generator’s cost curve at the first step reference price
2016,Analysis,"however , this output gap is only indicative because no output instructions are QQ100ltxlt1kQQ given the low energy prices during QQyearQQ , the output gap margin was reduced to $ QQmonthdayQQ for purposes of this analysis"
2016,Analysis,"prior to QQyearlag1QQ , the state of the market report used $ QQltxlt100QQ for the output gap margin"

2016,Analysis,"in the second step of the dispatch , the after - mitigation offer curve is used to determine dispatch instructions and locational prices"
2016,Analysis,"as previously illustrated , even though the offer curve is mitigated there is still the potential for the mitigated offer curve to be increased as a result of a high first - step reference price being influenced by a market participant raising prices"

2017,RTM,real - time market outcomes i
2017,RTM,"review of real - time market outcomes although only a small share of the power produced in ercot is transacted in the spot market , real - time energy prices are very important because they set the expectations for prices in the day - ahead market and bilateral forward markets where most transactions occur"
2017,RTM,"unless there are barriers preventing arbitrage of the prices between the spot and forward markets , the prices in the forward market should be directly related to the prices in the spot market ( i.e"
2017,RTM,", the spot prices and forward prices should converge over the long - run )"
2017,RTM,"hence , low prices in the real - time energy market will translate to low forward prices"
2017,RTM,"likewise , price spikes in the real - time energy market will increase prices in the forward markets"
2017,RTM,this section evaluates and summarizes electricity prices in the real - time market during QQyearQQ
2017,RTM,a
2017,RTM,real - time market prices the first analysis evaluates the total cost of supplying energy to serve load in the ercot wholesale market
2017,RTM,"in addition to the costs of energy , loads incur costs associated with ancillary services and a variety of non - market based expenses referred to as “ uplift"
2017,RTM,” an average “ all - in ” price of electricity has been calculated for ercot that is intended to reflect wholesale energy costs as well as these additional costs
2017,RTM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ summarizes changes in energy prices and other market costs by showing the all - in price of electricity , which is a measure of the total cost of serving load in ercot for QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ"
2017,RTM,the ercot - wide price in this figure is the load - weighted average of the real - time market prices from all zones
2017,RTM,ancillary services costs and uplift costs are divided by real - time load to show them on a per mwh basis
2017,RTM,QQmonthdayQQ ercot developed two energy price adders that are designed to improve its real - time energy pricing when conditions warrant or when ercot takes out - of - market actions for reliability
2017,RTM,"to distinguish the effects of the energy price adders , the operating reserve demand curve adder ( operating reserve adder ) and the reliability deployment price adder ( reliability adder ) are shown separate from the energy price"
2017,RTM,the operating reserve adder was implemented in mid - QQ1kltxlt1MQQ to account for the value of reserves based on the probability of reserves falling below the minimum contingency level and the value of lost load
2017,RTM,the reliability adder was implemented in QQmonthQQ QQyearlag2QQ as a mechanism to ensure that reliability deployments do not distort the energy prices
2017,RTM,"the reliability adder is calculated using a separate price run of sced , removing any reliability unit commitments ( ruc ) or deployed load capacity and recalculating prices"
2017,RTM,"when the recalculated system lambda ( average load price ) is higher than the initial system lambda , the increment is the adder"
2017,RTM,"QQmonthdayQQ for this analysis uplift includes : reliability unit commitment settlement , operating reserve demand curve ( ordc ) settlement , revenue neutrality total , emergency energy charges , base point deviation payments , emergency response service ( ers ) settlement , black start service settlement , block load transfer settlement , and the ercot system administrative fee"

2017,RTM,the figure above indicates that natural gas prices continued to be a primary driver of energy prices
2017,RTM,"this correlation is expected in a well - functioning , competitive market because fuel costs represent the majority of most suppliers ’ marginal production costs"
2017,RTM,"because suppliers in a competitive market have an incentive to offer supply at marginal costs and natural gas is the most widely - used fuel in ercot , changes in natural gas prices should translate to comparable changes in offer prices"
2017,RTM,"the average natural gas price in QQyearQQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu , up approximately QQmonthdayQQ % from the QQyearlag1QQ average price of $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu"
2017,RTM,"ercot average real - time energy prices increased nearly QQmonthdayQQ % , increasing from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ to $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearQQ"
2017,RTM,the average real - time energy price in QQyearQQ included small contributions from ercot’s energy price adders : $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh from the operating reserve adder and $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh from the reliability adder
2017,RTM,"these values were similar to the levels in QQyearlag1QQ ; $ QQxlt1QQ and $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh , for reserve and reliability adder , respectively"
2017,RTM,"the highest monthly average operating reserve adder for QQyearQQ occurred in QQmonthQQ , while the highest monthly average reliability adder occurred in QQmonthQQ"
2017,RTM,QQmonthdayQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report real - time market outcomes other cost categories continue to be a small portion of the all - in electricity price
2017,RTM,"ancillary services costs were $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh in QQyearQQ , down from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ because of continued low natural gas prices and lower ancillary service requirements"
2017,RTM,"uplift costs accounted for $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh of the all - in electricity price in QQyearQQ , up from $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,RTM,"in the context of providing the total cost of serving load in ercot , these values include both the ercot system administrative fee and the program costs for emergency response service ( ers ) , which are assessed to all loads"
2017,RTM,the total amount of uplifted costs in QQyearQQ was approximately $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million
2017,RTM,"there are many costs included as uplift , but the largest components are the ercot system administrative fee ( $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million or $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh ) , ers program costs ( $ QQltxlt100QQ million or $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh ) and the revenue neutrality allocation ( rena ) , which totaled $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million or $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh in QQyearQQ"
2017,RTM,virtually all of the increase in uplift costs in QQyearQQ was due to the increase in rena
2017,RTM,"specifically , rena was $ QQmonthdayQQ million ( $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh ) in QQyearlag1QQ and increased to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million ( $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh ) in QQyearQQ"
2017,RTM,"several factors can contribute to rena uplift , including QQmonthdayQQ ) setting a price floor in the real - time market at - $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ; QQmonthdayQQ ) settlement of day - ahead ptp obligations linked to options ; QQmonthdayQQ ) manual corrections that occur when the clearing price of ptp obligations in the day - ahead market is higher than the submitted bid price ; QQmonthdayQQ ) inconsistency between day - ahead and real - time market during market clearing ; and QQmonthdayQQ ) not including private network load when calculating load zone prices"
2017,RTM,more detailed studies show that almost all the rena uplift occurred in market hours when there was transmission congestion
2017,RTM,the two factors contributing most to rena uplift in QQyearQQ were the settlement of day - ahead ptp obligations linked to options and not including private network load when calculating load zones prices
2017,RTM,the amount of rena uplift associated with not including private network load in load zone prices is estimated to have exceeded $ QQltxlt100QQ million in QQyearQQ
2017,RTM,these impacts were addressed in late QQyearQQ with the implementation of nprr831

2017,RTM,"between QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , load growth caused by higher oil and natural gas production activity resulted in localized import constraints and higher prices"
2017,RTM,"even with continued investment in transmission facilities , the amount of wind generation additions have meant export limitations and resulting lower prices since QQyearlag2QQ"
2017,RTM,another factor influencing zonal price differences is congestion revenue right ( crr ) auction revenue distributions
2017,RTM,"they are distributed to qualified scheduling entities ( qses ) representing load , based on a zonal and ercot - wide monthly load - ratio share"
2017,RTM,the crr auction revenues have the effect of reducing the total cost to serve load borne by a qse
2017,RTM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ below shows the effect that this reduction has on a monthly basis , by zone"

2017,RTM,"focusing on zonal differences , a smaller credit in houston relative to the ercot - wide crr auction revenue credit and a larger credit in the west again resulted in the net price difference between the two zones being even higher in QQyearQQ"

2017,DAM,day - ahead market performance ii
2017,DAM,day - ahead market performance ercot’s day - ahead market allows participants to make financially binding forward purchases and sales of power for delivery in real - time
2017,DAM,"offers to sell can take the form of either a three - part supply offer , which allows sellers to reflect the unique financial and operational characteristics of a specific generation resource , or an energy - only offer , which is location specific but is not associated with a generation resource"
2017,DAM,bids to buy are also location specific
2017,DAM,"in addition to the purchase and sale of power , the day - ahead market also includes ancillary services and point - to - point ( ptp ) obligations"
2017,DAM,ptp obligations allow parties to hedge the incremental cost of congestion between day - ahead and real - time operations
2017,DAM,"with the exception of the acquisition of ancillary service capacity , the day - ahead market is a financial market"
2017,DAM,"although all bids and offers are evaluated for the ability to reliably flow on the transmission network , there are no operational obligations resulting from the day - ahead market"
2017,DAM,"day - ahead transactions QQmonthQQ be made for a variety of reasons , including satisfying the participant’s own demand , managing risk by hedging the participant’s exposure to real - time prices or congestion , or arbitraging the real - time prices"
2017,DAM,"for example , load - serving entities can insure against the higher volatility of real - time market prices by purchasing in the day - ahead market"
2017,DAM,"finally , the day - ahead market helps inform participants ’ generator commitment decisions"
2017,DAM,"for all of these reasons , the effective performance of the day - ahead market is essential"
2017,DAM,"in this section , energy pricing outcomes from the day - ahead market are reviewed and convergence with real - time energy prices is examined"
2017,DAM,"the volume of activity in the day - ahead market , including a discussion of ptp obligations , is also reviewed"
2017,DAM,this section concludes with a review of the ancillary service markets
2017,DAM,a
2017,DAM,day - ahead market prices one indicator of market performance is the extent to which forward and real - time spot prices converge over time
2017,DAM,forward prices will converge with real - time prices when : ( QQmonthdayQQ ) there are low barriers to shifting purchases and sales between the forward and real - time markets ; and ( QQmonthdayQQ ) sufficient information is available to market participants to allow them to develop accurate expectations of future real - time prices
2017,DAM,"when these conditions are met , market participants can be expected to arbitrage predictable differences between forward prices and real - time spot prices by increasing net purchases in the lower priced market and increasing net sales in the higher priced market"
2017,DAM,"this improves the convergence of forward and real - time prices , which should lead to improved commitment of resources needed to satisfy the system’s real - time needs"
2017,DAM,"in this subsection , price convergence between the day - ahead and real - time markets is evaluated"
2017,DAM,"this average price difference reveals whether persistent and predictable differences exist QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQmonthdayQQ / day - ahead market performance between day - ahead and real - time prices , which participants should arbitrage over the long term"
2017,DAM,"to measure the short - term deviations between real - time and day - ahead prices , the average of the absolute value of the difference between the day - ahead and real - time price are calculated on a daily basis"
2017,DAM,"this measure captures the volatility of the daily price differences , which QQmonthQQ be large even if the day - ahead and real - time energy prices are the same on average"
2017,DAM,"QQmonthdayQQ figure QQmonthdayQQ summarizes the price convergence between the day - ahead and real - time markets , by month in QQyearQQ"
2017,DAM,price convergence was very good in QQyearQQ ; day - ahead and real - time prices both averaged $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearQQ the lack of discernable day - ahead premium is likely due to the overall low energy prices and is consistent with low expectations for shortage conditions given ample installed reserves
2017,DAM,risk is typically lower for loads purchasing in the day - ahead market and higher for generators selling day ahead
2017,DAM,the higher risk for generators is associated with the potential of incurring a forced outage and having to buy back energy at real - time prices
2017,DAM,this explains why the highest premium in QQyearQQ occurred during QQmonthQQ when the highest relative demand and highest prices occurred
2017,DAM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ : convergence between day - ahead and real - time energy prices $ QQltxlt100QQ day ahead real time absolute difference $ QQmonthdayQQ $ QQmonthdayQQ electricity price ( $ / mwh ) $ QQmonthdayQQ $ QQmonthdayQQ $ QQmonthdayQQ $ QQmonthdayQQ $ QQxlt1QQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ for instance , if day - ahead prices are $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh on two consecutive days while real - time prices are $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh and $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh respectively , the absolute price difference between the day - ahead market and the real - time market would be $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh on both days , while the difference in average prices would be $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh"
2017,DAM,"QQmonthdayQQ these values are simple averages , rather than load - weighted averages as presented in figures QQmonthdayQQ and QQmonthdayQQ"
2017,DAM,"QQmonthdayQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report day - ahead market performance real - time energy prices in ercot are allowed to rise to levels that are much higher than the shortage pricing in other organized electricity markets , which increases risk and would explain a higher day - ahead premium in ercot"
2017,DAM,"although most months experienced a day - ahead premium in QQyearQQ , it should not be expected that every month will produce a day - ahead premium"
2017,DAM,"the real - time risks that lead to the premiums will materialize unexpectedly on occasion , resulting in real - time prices that exceed day - ahead prices ( e.g"
2017,DAM,", in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ , and QQmonthQQ )"
2017,DAM,"the average absolute difference between day - ahead and real - time prices was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearQQ – a slight increase from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh and $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearlag2QQ , respectively"

2017,DAM,"notably , the volatility in the houston zone increased in QQyearQQ in contrast to the relative stability of the other zones"
2017,DAM,the larger difference between day - ahead and real - time prices observed in the houston zone is likely associated with transmission congestion related to houston import constraints

2017,DAM,point - to - point obligations purchases of ptp obligations comprise a significant portion of day - ahead market activity
2017,DAM,"they are similar to , and can be used to complement , congestion revenue rights ( crrs )"
2017,DAM,"crrs , as more fully described in section iii : transmission congestion and congestion revenue rights , are acquired via monthly and annual auctions and allocations"
2017,DAM,crrs accrue value to their owner based on locational price differences as determined by the day - ahead market
2017,DAM,participants buy ptp obligations by paying the difference in prices between two locations in the day - ahead market
2017,DAM,they receive the difference in prices between the same two locations in the real - time market
2017,DAM,"hence , a participant that owns a crr can use its crr proceeds from the day - ahead market to buy a ptp obligation between the same two points in order to transfer its hedge to real time"

2017,DAM,"this indicates that , in aggregate , buyers of ptp obligation profited from the transactions"
2017,DAM,this occurs when real - time congestion is greater than day - ahead market congestion
2017,DAM,"across the year , and in nine of twelve months , the acquisition charges were less than the revenues received , implying that expectations of congestion as evidenced by day - ahead purchases were less than the actual congestion that occurred in real - time"
2017,DAM,"during QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ these expectations were reversed , as congestion anticipated in the day - ahead market did not materialize in real time"

2017,DAM,"different from figure QQmonthdayQQ and figure QQmonthdayQQ above , the volumes in this figure do not net out the injections and withdrawals occurring at the same location"
2017,DAM,it presents average purchase volumes on both a monthly and annual basis
2017,DAM,"for all ptp obligations that source at a generator location , the capacity up to the actual generator output is considered to be hedging the real - time congestion associated with generating at that location"
2017,DAM,the figure above shows that this comprised most of the volume of ptp obligations purchased
2017,DAM,the remaining volumes of ptp obligations are not directly linked to a physical position and are assumed to be purchased primarily to arbitrage anticipated price differences between two locations
2017,DAM,this arbitrage activity is further separated by type of market participant
2017,DAM,"physical parties are those that have actual real - time load or generation , whereas financial parties have neither"
2017,DAM,"financial parties purchased QQmonthdayQQ % of the total volume of ptp obligations in QQyearQQ , a slight decrease from QQmonthdayQQ % in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearlag2QQ"
2017,DAM,"to the extent the price difference between the source and sink of a ptp obligation is greater in real - time than it was in the day - ahead market , the owner will profit"

2017,DAM,"ancillary services market the primary ancillary services are regulation up , regulation down , responsive reserves , and non - spinning reserves"
2017,DAM,market participants QQmonthQQ self - schedule ancillary services or purchase them through the ercot markets
2017,DAM,"in general , the purpose of responsive and non - spinning reserves is QQltxlt100QQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report day - ahead market performance to protect the system against unforeseen contingencies ( e.g"
2017,DAM,", unplanned generator outages , load forecast error , wind forecast error ) , rather than for meeting normal load fluctuations"
2017,DAM,"ercot procures responsive reserves to ensure that the system frequency can quickly be restored to appropriate levels after a sudden , unplanned outage of generation capacity"
2017,DAM,"non - spinning reserves are provided from slower responding generation capacity , and can be deployed alone , or to restore responsive reserve capacity"
2017,DAM,"regulation reserves are capacity that responds every four seconds , either increasing or decreasing as necessary to fill the gap between energy deployments and actual system load"
2017,DAM,"since QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag2QQ , ercot has calculated the requirement for responsive reserves based on a variable hourly need"
2017,DAM,this requirement is determined and posted in advance for the year
2017,DAM,ercot procures non - spinning reserves such that the combination of non - spinning reserves and regulation up will cover QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of the calculated net load forecast error
2017,DAM,ercot will always procure a minimum quantity of non - spinning reserves greater than or equal to the largest generation unit
2017,DAM,total requirements for ancillary services declined again in QQyearQQ
2017,DAM,"the average total requirement in QQyearQQ was less than 4,800 mw , a reduction from the average total requirement of approximately 4,900 mw in QQyearlag1QQ and 5,300 mw in QQyearlag2QQ"
2017,DAM,the reduction in QQyearQQ was primarily to responsive reserve
2017,DAM,figure QQmonthdayQQ displays the hourly average quantities of ancillary services procured for each month in QQyearQQ

2017,DAM,figure QQltxlt100QQ presents this alternate picture of ancillary service procurement in QQyearQQ
2017,DAM,in this view the large differences in quantities between some adjacent hours are readily apparent
2017,DAM,"for example , capacity requirements increase almost QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw in hour QQmonthdayQQ , decrease QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw in hour QQmonthdayQQ and gradually increase for the next two hours"
2017,DAM,hour QQmonthdayQQ provides another example of a large increase in requirements in the hour prior to a large decrease
2017,DAM,"this pattern is a result of the methodology which sets responsive and non - spinning reserve quantities in four hour blocks , while regulation reserve quantities are set hourly"
2017,DAM,"although the current ancillary service procurement methodology minimizes the quantities required , smoothing out these discontinuities QQmonthQQ reduce or eliminate the occasional ancillary service price spikes"

2017,DAM,the absence of meaningful occurrences of scarcity conditions in QQyearQQ resulted in relatively small variation in average energy prices and correspondingly stable ancillary service prices

2017,DAM,this means that market participants need not include expectations of forgone energy sales in their ancillary service capacity offers
2017,DAM,"because ancillary service clearing prices explicitly account for the opportunity costs of selling energy in the day - ahead market , ancillary service prices should generally be correlated with day - ahead energy prices"
2017,DAM,"during the recent period of low energy prices , this correlation has not been apparent"
2017,DAM,"monthly average prices for responsive reserve varied from $ QQmonthdayQQ to $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , with the highest price occurring in QQmonthQQ"
2017,DAM,one possible explanation for this decoupling from day - ahead energy prices is that unit commitment patterns have changed because of high wind generation and less online capacity capable of providing reserves
2017,DAM,"this reduction in online capacity , especially in off - peak periods has led to higher prices for reserve prices in shoulder months"
2017,DAM,table QQmonthdayQQ compares the average annual price for each ancillary service in QQyearQQ with QQyearlag1QQ
2017,DAM,the changes in total requirements for ancillary services in QQyearQQ led to concomitant changes in ancillary service prices
2017,DAM,"the average price for responsive reserve decreased in QQyearQQ , as did the total requirements for the service"
2017,DAM,reductions in the average price for non - spinning reserves is QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / day - ahead market performance consistent with the reduced requirements for this product

2017,DAM,"when ercot experiences a shortage of operating reserves , real - time prices will rise to reflect the expected value of lost load embedded in the ordc mechanism"
2017,DAM,the expectation of higher real - time prices will tend to drive up the day - ahead price for ancillary services
2017,DAM,"hence , the lack of shortages contributed to the low average ancillary service prices shown in the table"
2017,DAM,"in contrast to the individual ancillary service prices , figure QQltxlt100QQ shows the monthly total ancillary service costs per mwh of ercot load and the average real - time energy price for QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ"
2017,DAM,"with no meaningful occurrences of scarcity conditions in QQyearQQ , the total cost for ancillary services was relatively low during summer months"

2017,DAM,"if all ancillary services could be continually reviewed and adjusted in response to changing market conditions , the efficiencies would flow to all market participants and would be greater than what can be achieved by qses acting individually"
2017,DAM,"since the initial consideration of ercot’s nodal market design , the imm has been recommending that ercot implement real - time co - optimization of energy and ancillary services because of this improved efficiency"
2017,DAM,the ercot market appropriately reflects the tradeoff between providing capacity for ancillary services versus providing energy in its co - optimized day - ahead market
2017,DAM,those same tradeoffs exist in real time
2017,DAM,"without comprehensive , market - wide co - optimization , the ercot market will continue to be subject to the choices of individual qses"
2017,DAM,these choices are likely to be in the qse’s best interest
2017,DAM,they are not likely to lead to the most economic provision of energy and ancillary services for the market as a whole
2017,DAM,"further , qses without large resource portfolios QQltxlt100QQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report day - ahead market performance are effectively precluded from participating in ancillary service markets because of the replacement risk they face having to rely on a supplemental ancillary services market ( sasm )"
2017,DAM,this replacement risk is substantial
2017,DAM,clearing prices for ancillary services procured in sasm are typically ten to thirty times greater than annual average clearing prices from the day - ahead market
2017,DAM,"ercot uses sasms either to procure replacement ancillary service capacity when transmission constraints arise that make the capacity undeliverable , or when outages or limitations at a generating unit lead to failure to provide the ancillary service"

2017,DAM,that is to move into or out of ancillary service positions awarded day ahead
2017,DAM,"sasms were infrequent largely because of the dearth of ancillary service offers typically available throughout the operating day , limiting re - configuration opportunities"
2017,DAM,"the sasm procurement method , while offer based , is inefficient and problematic"
2017,DAM,"because ancillary services are not co - optimized with energy in the sasm , potential suppliers are required to estimate opportunity costs rather than have the auction engine calculate it directly , which leads to resources that underestimate opportunity costs being inefficiently preferred over resources that overestimate opportunity costs"
2017,DAM,"further , the need to estimate the opportunity costs , which change constantly and significantly over time as the energy price changes , provides a strong disincentive to sasm participation , contributing to the observed lack of sasm offers"
2017,DAM,the paucity of sasm offers frequently leaves ercot with two choices in response to ancillary service un - deliverability or failure to provide : ( QQmonthdayQQ ) use an out - of - market ancillary service procurement action with its inherent inefficiencies ; or ( QQmonthdayQQ ) operate with a deficiency of ancillary services with its inherent increased reliability risk
2017,DAM,"real - time co - optimization of energy and ancillary services does not require resources to estimate opportunity costs , would eliminate the need for the sasm mechanism , and allow ancillary services to be continually shifted to the most efficient provider"
2017,DAM,"because co - optimization allows the real - time market far more flexibility to procure energy and ancillary services from online resources , it would also reduce ercot’s need to use ruc procedures to acquire ancillary services : its biggest benefit would be to effectively handle situations where entities that had day - ahead ancillary service awards were unable to fulfill that commitment , e.g"

2017,Congestion,transmission congestion and crrs iii
2017,Congestion,transmission congestion and congestion revenue rights one of the most important functions of any electricity market is to manage the flows of power on the transmission network by not allowing additional power flow on transmission facilities that have reached their operating limits
2017,Congestion,the action taken to ensure operating limits are not violated is called congestion management
2017,Congestion,the effect of congestion management is to change the output level of one or more generators to reduce the amount of electricity flowing on any transmission facility nearing its operating limit
2017,Congestion,this leads to higher costs as a result of necessary changes to generation output to ensure that operating limits are not violated
2017,Congestion,"this increase in more expensive generation or decrease in less expensive generation , or both results in different prices at different nodes"
2017,Congestion,the decision about which generator ( QQmonthQQ ) will vary its output is based on the generator’s energy offer curve and how much of its output will flow across the overloaded transmission element
2017,Congestion,this leads to the dispatch of the most efficient generation to reliably serve demand while providing locational marginal pricing reflective of the actions taken to ensure system security
2017,Congestion,"the locational difference in prices produced by congestion can provide challenges to parties that have transacted in long term power contracts ; namely , if the production point ( for a seller ) or consumption point ( for a purchaser ) is different from the contracted delivery point , the party is subject to the risk that the prices will be different when settled"
2017,Congestion,"congestion revenue rights ( crr ) markets enable parties to purchase the rights to those price differences in seasonal and monthly blocks , and thus achieve some level of price certainty"
2017,Congestion,"this section of the report summarizes transmission congestion in QQyearQQ , provides a review of the costs and frequency of transmission congestion in both the day - ahead and real - time markets , and concludes with a review of the activity in the crr market"

2017,Congestion,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / transmission congestion and crrs figure QQltxlt100QQ provides a comparison of the amount of time transmission constraints were active and binding for various load levels in QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ
2017,Congestion,this figure also indicates the average number of constraints in a real - time contingency analysis ( rtca ) execution for each load level
2017,Congestion,rtca is the process in which the resulting flows on the transmission system are evaluated after systematically removing elements of the transmission system
2017,Congestion,a thermal constraint exists if the outage of a transmission element ( contingency ) results in a flow higher than the rating of a different element
2017,Congestion,binding transmission constraints are those for which the dispatch levels of generating resources are actually altered in order to maintain transmission flows at reliable levels

2017,Congestion,the percentage of time with active constraints in QQyearQQ was the highest since the implementation of the ercot nodal market in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and was higher at nearly all load levels
2017,Congestion,"the most notable difference between QQyearQQ and QQyearlag1QQ was that , while rtca on average showed fewer constraints in QQyearQQ , the percentage of time with an active constraint in each load level was higher in QQyearQQ than QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Congestion,this difference is explained by a QQmonthdayQQ % increase in the amount of time with an active generic transmission constraint ( gtc )
2017,Congestion,a gtc was active QQltxlt100QQ % of the time in QQltxlt100QQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report transmission congestion and crrs QQyearQQ
2017,Congestion,"gtcs are not derived from rtca , but rather are determined by off - line studies and their limits are typically determined prior to the operating day"
2017,Congestion,gtcs are used to ensure that the generation dispatch does not violate a stability or a voltage condition
2017,Congestion,certain gtc limits are determined in real - time using the voltage stability assessment component of the energy management system
2017,Congestion,"using these tools to continuously evaluate the north to houston , panhandle , laredo , and the rio grande valley import limits provides a more accurate limit than what was could be determined as part of the day - ahead process"
2017,Congestion,"actions taken to resolve a gtc QQmonthQQ also benefit other potential congestion issues , resulting in fewer thermal constraints in rtca"
2017,Congestion,"this could explain the lower number of rtca constraints overall , but also the increase in constraint activity in QQyearQQ"

2017,Congestion,this trend is expected because most transmission and generation outages for maintenance and upgrades occur during the shoulder months
2017,Congestion,cross - zonal congestion in QQyearQQ was the most costly since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ because of the increased frequency and cost associated with houston import constraints
2017,Congestion,all zones except for the houston zone experienced an increase in price impacts in QQyearQQ
2017,Congestion,"although the north to houston constraint has been a significant contributor to total congestion in the past , most of the increased congestion in QQyearQQ was attributable to conditions that materialized last year"

2017,Congestion,real - time constraints the review of real - time congestion begins with describing the areas with the highest financial impact from congestion
2017,Congestion,"for this discussion , a congested area is determined by consolidating multiple real - time transmission constraints that are determined to be similar because of geographic proximity and constraint direction"
2017,Congestion,"there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unique constraints that were binding at some point during QQyearQQ with a median financial impact of approximately $ 235,000"
2017,Congestion,"in QQyearlag1QQ , there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unique constraints with a median financial impact of $ 150,000"
2017,Congestion,the increased frequency and uniqueness of the constraints contributed to higher congestion costs in QQyearQQ

2017,Congestion,"by the end of QQyearQQ , there was almost QQmonthdayQQ gw of generation capacity in the panhandle area , of which QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % was wind generation"
2017,Congestion,"the highest gtc limit for the panhandle was less than QQmonthdayQQ gw , leading to frequent ( QQmonthdayQQ % of the intervals ) and costly congestion when the wind output was high"
2017,Congestion,a notable contributor to the low limit for the panhandle gtc were outages on relatively new transmission facilities owned by ett
2017,Congestion,these outages were required after the risk of structural damage to its transmission facilities was identified and required immediate inspection and possible repair
2017,Congestion,outages of the facilities QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / transmission congestion and crrs limited the export of the panhandle wind generation
2017,Congestion,"the average shadow price of the panhandle gtc during binding intervals was $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh , reflecting the difference between system - wide average price and negative prices from wind generation"
2017,Congestion,"this , combined with the frequent need to control the panhandle gtc , made the constraint the most costly"
2017,Congestion,"the second most costly constraint in QQyearQQ was the north to houston constraint , comprised of a gtc and multiple thermal constraints , including the double circuit singleton to zenith QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines , the double circuit jewett to singleton QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines , and the gibbons creek to singleton QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines"
2017,Congestion,"at $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million , this constraint was twice as costly in QQyearQQ as in QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Congestion,congestion declined sharply after QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ when colorado bend combined cycle unit QQmonthdayQQ ( installed capacity of QQ1kltxlt1MQQ mw ) came into service
2017,Congestion,"further , the considerable flooding caused by hurricane harvey forced load offline , also relieving congestion"
2017,Congestion,"congestion in the fall months was due to outages along the north to houston corridor , which were scheduled to facilitate the construction of the houston import project"
2017,Congestion,congestion in the eagle mountain area between dallas and fort - worth was the next highest valued constraint
2017,Congestion,"ercot’s QQyearQQ regional transmission plan report28 recommended transmission upgrades to this area to address the constraints of the wagley robertson to blue mound QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line , the wagley robertson to summerfield QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line , and the eagle mountain to morris dido QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line"
2017,Congestion,congestion in this area of the north zone is typically associated with high wind and high load conditions limiting flows from the west
2017,Congestion,"the fourth - highest congested element on this list , the double circuit twin oak switch to gibbons creek QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines , was impacted by the north to houston congestion"
2017,Congestion,"the largest impact occurred in QQmonthQQ during construction of the north portion of the houston import project , the limestone to gibbons creek QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines"
2017,Congestion,this constraint is noteworthy because of the dual impacts to the gibbons creek unit
2017,Congestion,output from gibbons creek alleviates congestion on the twin oak switch to gibbons creek QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines
2017,Congestion,"however , the same generation has a negative effect on the previously described north to houston constraints"
2017,Congestion,"at times , both the elements in north to houston and a twin oak switch to gibbons creek QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line would be binding , producing opposite shift factor signals for the gibbons creek unit"
2017,Congestion,"the valley area constraints are located on the west side of the lower rio grande valley and include the north mcallen to west mcallen QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line ( $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million ) , the azteca to south edinburg QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line ( $ QQmonthdayQQ million ) , and the north edinburg QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv transformer ( $ QQmonthdayQQ million )"

2017,Congestion,"congestion on the last two constraints listed above , the elmcreek to skyline QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line and the calaveras to pawnee QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line , was due to planned outages in san antonio , primarily in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ"
2017,Congestion,irresolvable constraints the shadow price of a constraint is the value at which economic dispatch results in profit - maximizing for the generators while also meeting demand at the lowest overall production cost
2017,Congestion,"however , if the dispatch cannot resolve a reliability problem with the available generators , the shadow price would continue to increase as the economic dispatch sought a solution"
2017,Congestion,in situations where there is no generation solution the shadow price would theoretically rise to QQxgt1BQQ
2017,Congestion,"therefore , the shadow price is capped"
2017,Congestion,"shadow price caps are based on a reviewed methodology , QQmonthdayQQ and are intended to reflect the level of reduced reliability that occurs when a constraint is irresolvable"
2017,Congestion,"currently ( and throughout QQyearQQ ) the shadow price caps are $ 5,000 per mw for base - case ( non - contingency ) or voltage violations , $ 4,500 per mw for QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv , $ 3,500 per mw for QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv , and $ 2,800 per mw for QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv thermal violations"
2017,Congestion,"gtcs are considered voltage constraints with a shadow price cap of $ 5,000 per mw"
2017,Congestion,"when a constraint becomes irresolvable , chronically reaching the shadow price cap , ercot’s dispatch software cannot find a dispatch combination to reduce the flows on the transmission element ( QQmonthQQ ) of concern to a reliable operation level"
2017,Congestion,"a regional peaker net margin mechanism is used such that once local price increases accumulate to a predefined threshold because of an irresolvable constraint , the constraint’s shadow price cap is re - evaluated"

2017,Congestion,"the remaining constraints , although they occurred frequently , had moderate financial impacts"
2017,Congestion,these high frequency constraints with minimal congestion costs occur when the generation to be re - dispatched is similarly priced
2017,Congestion,the fourth most frequent constraint in QQyearQQ was the solstice to pig creek QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line located in the lower part of the far west region where transmission is sparse
2017,Congestion,this particular area is unique because a generation resource of less than QQmonthdayQQ mw contributes to the injection point of the constraint
2017,Congestion,"because of the nature of the modeling requirements at ercot , the resource is not modeled in sced and does not receive base points"
2017,Congestion,"additionally , there is not an economic incentive to alter the output to alleviate congestion as it is not calculated into the sced dispatch"

2017,Congestion,"interestingly , QQyearQQ was the second year that the majority of the most costly day - ahead constraints were also costly real - time constraints"
2017,Congestion,a contributing factor to this convergence was that ercot continually hones the constraint list to monitor which constraints should be included in the day - ahead market analysis to be consistent with market activities observed in real - time
2017,Congestion,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / transmission congestion and crrs the panhandle gtc incurred less congestion value in the day - ahead market than the real - time market as a result of less wind generation participating in the day - ahead market likely because of the uncertainty associated with predicting its output

2017,Congestion,the majority of the ercot congestion was due to north to houston congestion caused by outages associated with the houston import project
2017,Congestion,north to houston congestion is expected to decrease in QQyearlead1QQ with the final implementation of the transmission upgrades
2017,Congestion,the shoulder months showed higher activity for the day - ahead congestion costs as well as in the real - time congestion values
2017,Congestion,QQmonthQQ
2017,Congestion,"congestion revenue rights market congestion can be significant from an economic perspective , compelling the dispatch of higher - cost resources because power produced by lower - cost resources cannot be delivered because of transmission constraints"
2017,Congestion,this causes different clearing prices for energy at different locations
2017,Congestion,"under the nodal market design , one means by which ercot market participants can hedge these price differences is by acquiring congestion revenue rights ( crrs ) between any two settlement points"
2017,Congestion,crrs QQmonthQQ be acquired in semi - annual and monthly auctions while pre - assigned congestion revenue rights ( pcrrs ) are allocated to certain participants based on their historical patterns of transmission usage
2017,Congestion,parties receiving pcrrs pay only a fraction of the auction value of a crr between the same source and sink
2017,Congestion,both crrs and pcrrs entitle the holder to payments or charges that correspond to the difference in day - ahead locational prices of the source and sink
2017,Congestion,crr costs and auction revenues figure QQltxlt100QQ details the congestion cost as calculated by shadow price and flow on binding constraints in the crr auctions
2017,Congestion,"note that this calculation , based on the binding constraint location , is similar to the calculation used earlier in this report to display the zonal location of real - time and day - ahead congestion costs and is different from the method used to determine crr revenue allocation"
2017,Congestion,the costs are broken down by the zonal location of the constraint and whether they were incurred in a monthly auction ( monthly ) or a seasonal or annual auction ( forward )

2017,Congestion,"all zones , except south and west procured in the forward auctions , show increases in crr congestion compared to very large increases in day - ahead and real - time congestion"

2017,Congestion,revenues from cross - zone crrs are allocated to loads ercot wide
2017,Congestion,revenues from crrs that have the source and sink in the same geographic zone are allocated to loads within that zone
2017,Congestion,"allocating crr auction revenues in this manner reduces the net cost for load purchases in heavily - congested areas , but it does so whether the congestion had raised prices in the area or lowered prices in the area"
2017,Congestion,"as a case in point , congestion lowered prices in the west zone to below the ercot average , as shown above in figure QQmonthdayQQ : effective real - time energy market prices"
2017,Congestion,"however , because so many crrs were purchased in the west zone to capture the value of this price lowering congestion , a higher than load - ratio share portion of the crr revenue gets distributed to qualified scheduling entities representing west zone load , thus further lowering the effective price paid by load in the west zone"
2017,Congestion,"as previously mentioned in this section , the only parties eligible to receive pcrrs are non - opt - in entities ( noies )"
2017,Congestion,they are charged only a fraction of the pcrr auction value

2017,Congestion,"for the entire year of QQyearQQ , participants spent $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million to procure crrs and received almost twice as much at $ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ million"
2017,Congestion,"in general , this difference occurred because the substantial increase in congestion that occurred in QQyearQQ was not foreseen by the market"
2017,Congestion,there were two significant periods of congestion that account for this difference : QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ
2017,Congestion,"in both cases , transmission outages related to construction of new facilities contributed to the substantial unforeseen increases in congestion"
2017,Congestion,the next analysis of aggregated crr positions adds day - ahead congestion rent to the picture
2017,Congestion,"day - ahead congestion rent is the difference between payments and charges of three - part offers , energy only offers , energy only bids , ptp obligation bids , and ptp obligation bids linked to QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report transmission congestion and crrs options in day - ahead market"

2017,Congestion,"this indeed was the case in QQyearQQ , where payments to crr owners was QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of day - ahead congestion rent"
2017,Congestion,"in QQyearlag1QQ , this ratio was QQ100ltxlt1kQQ %"
2017,Congestion,"QQmonthdayQQ under protocol section 7.9.3.1 , day - ahead market congestion rent is calculated as the sum of the following payments and charges : ( a ) the total of payments to all qses for cleared day - ahead market energy offers , whether through three - part supply offers or through day - ahead market energy - only offer curves , calculated under section 4.6.2.1 , day - ahead energy payment ; ( b ) the total of charges to all qses for cleared day - ahead market energy bids , calculated under section 4.6.2.2 , day - ahead energy charge ; and ( c ) the total of charges or payments to all qses for ptp obligation bids cleared in the day - ahead market , calculated under section 4.6.3 , settlement for ptp obligations bought in day - ahead market"

2017,Congestion,"in QQyearQQ , owners of crrs in aggregate made a substantial profit on their crr holdings"
2017,Congestion,payments to crr owners in QQyearQQ were almost double the total cost paid to acquire the crrs
2017,Congestion,"as we discuss above , this was primarily due to unanticipated factors that led to significantly higher congestion in QQyearQQ"
2017,Congestion,the figure shows that this was not the case in recent years
2017,Congestion,"in QQyearlag2QQ , crr owners were paid less than the total cost paid to obtain them"
2017,Congestion,"in QQyearlag1QQ , it appears that crr owners made a small profit , but the cost to obtain the crrs reflects the discounted amounts that noies paid to obtain pcrrs"
2017,Congestion,"adding the noie discount to the auction revenue in QQyearlag1QQ would show crrs , in aggregate , to be unprofitable"
2017,Congestion,another item to note from these historical values is the relatively flat auction revenue
2017,Congestion,the costs paid to acquire crrs varied in a narrow range between $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ and $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million per year since the start of the nodal market
2017,Congestion,"this QQmonthQQ imply that aggregate crr profitability is less dependent on crr owners making acquisition decisions based on sophisticated analysis , and more likely driven by the vagaries of annual transmission congestion patterns"

2017,Congestion,"while the target value is paid to crr account holders most of the time , there are two circumstances that cause ercot to pay less than the target value ( i.e"
2017,Congestion,", crrs are not fully funded )"
2017,Congestion,the first circumstance happens when the crr is modeled on the day - ahead network and causes a flow on a transmission line that exceeds the line’s limit
2017,Congestion,"in other words , the transmission capability assumed in the crr market is ultimately higher than in the day - ahead market , which can occur because of outages or other factors that reduce transfer capability"
2017,Congestion,"in this case , crrs with a positive value that have a source or a sink located at a resource node settlement point are paid a lower amount than the target value"
2017,Congestion,"the second circumstance occurs when there is not enough day - ahead congestion rent to pay all the crrs at target ( or derated , if applicable ) value"
2017,Congestion,"in this case , all holders of positively valued crrs receive a prorated shortfall charge such that the congestion revenue plus the shortfall charge can pay all crrs at target or derated value"
2017,Congestion,"this shortfall charge has the effect of lowering the net amount paid to crr account holders ; however , if at the end of the month there is excess day - ahead congestion rent that has not been paid out to crr account holders , the excess congestion rent can be used to make whole the crr account holders that received shortfall charges"
2017,Congestion,"if there is not enough excess congestion rent from the month , the rolling crr balancing fund can be drawn upon to make whole crr account holders that received shortfall charges"
2017,Congestion,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the crr balancing fund since the beginning of QQyearlag2QQ
2017,Congestion,"even though the amount of the fund was under $ QQmonthdayQQ million in five months of QQyearlag2QQ and two months of QQyearlag1QQ , it started QQyearQQ at its capped value of $ QQmonthdayQQ million and was not drawn upon during the year"
2017,Congestion,"while there were monthly shortfalls in day - ahead market settlement in QQyearlag2QQ and QQyearlag1QQ , a surplus occurred for each month in QQyearQQ , and the total day - ahead surplus was $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million"

2017,Congestion,these price spreads are interesting as many loads QQmonthQQ have contracts that hedge to the hub price and are thus exposed to the price differential between the hub and its corresponding load zone

2017,Congestion,of note is the relatively poor convergence between the forward crr price spreads for the west load zone and the actual price spreads
2017,Congestion,"this QQmonthQQ have been because of the difficulty forecasting the price impacts of variable wind output , or the added uncertainty of whether or not outages associated with ett’s structural maintenance are viable in such wind conditions"

2017,Supply/Demand,"specific analysis of the large quantity of installed wind generation is included , along with a discussion of the daily generation commitment characteristics"
2017,Supply/Demand,this section concludes with a review of the contributions from demand response resources
2017,Supply/Demand,a
2017,Supply/Demand,ercot load in QQyearQQ the changes in overall load levels from year to year can be shown by tracking the changes in average load levels
2017,Supply/Demand,this metric tends to capture changes in load over a large portion of the hours during the year
2017,Supply/Demand,separately evaluating the changes in the load during the highest - demand hours of the year is also important
2017,Supply/Demand,significant changes in peak demand levels play a major role in assessing the need for new resources
2017,Supply/Demand,the level of peak demand also affects the probability and frequency of shortage conditions ( i.e
2017,Supply/Demand,", conditions where firm load is served but minimum operating reserves are not maintained )"
2017,Supply/Demand,the expectation of resource adequacy is based on the value of electric service to customers and the harm or inconvenience to customers that can result from interruptions to that service
2017,Supply/Demand,"hence , both of these dimensions of load during QQyearQQ are examined in this subsection and summarized in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ"
2017,Supply/Demand,"this figure shows peak load and average load in each of the ercot geographic zones from QQyearlag2QQ to QQyearQQ in each zone , as in most electrical systems , peak demand significantly exceeds average demand"
2017,Supply/Demand,the north zone is the largest zone ( with about QQltxlt100QQ % of the total ercot load ) ; the south and houston zones are comparable ( QQmonthdayQQ % ) while the west zone is the smallest ( QQmonthdayQQ % of the total ercot load )
2017,Supply/Demand,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ also shows the annual non - coincident peak load for each zone
2017,Supply/Demand,"this is the highest load that occurred in a particular zone for one hour during the year ; however , the peak can occur in different hours for different zones"
2017,Supply/Demand,"as a result , the sum of the non - coincident peaks for the zones is greater than the annual ercot peak load"
2017,Supply/Demand,"QQmonthdayQQ for purposes of this analysis , non - opt in entity ( noie ) load zones have been included with the proximate geographic zone"

2017,Supply/Demand,all zones showed an increase in average real - time load in QQyearQQ
2017,Supply/Demand,"the west zone saw the largest average load increase at QQmonthdayQQ % , which was likely due to continuing robust oil and natural gas production activity"
2017,Supply/Demand,weather impacts on load in QQyearQQ were mixed
2017,Supply/Demand,"cooling degree days , a metric that is highly correlated with weather - related summer load , exhibited no change in houston , decreased in dallas and increased in austin as compared to QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Supply/Demand,"summer conditions in QQyearQQ produced a peak load of 69,512 mw on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ , short of the ercot - wide coincident peak hourly demand record of 71,110 mw set on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Supply/Demand,"further , demand did not ever exceed 70,000 mw in QQyearQQ , compared to five separate hours in QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Supply/Demand,the zones experienced varying changes in peak load
2017,Supply/Demand,"the west zone continued to experience the highest percentage growth in peak load , which was likely driven by continuing growth in oil and natural gas production"
2017,Supply/Demand,"to provide a more detailed analysis of load at the hourly level , figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ compares load duration curves for each year from QQyearlag2QQ to QQyearQQ"
2017,Supply/Demand,a load duration curve illustrates the number of hours QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report demand and supply ( shown on the horizontal axis ) that load exceeds a particular level ( shown on the vertical axis )

2017,Supply/Demand,"in QQyearlag1QQ , the first full year with variable procurement , the quantity of megawatts offered but not accepted by load resources increased"
2017,Supply/Demand,"during QQyearlag1QQ , there were no system - wide manual deployments of load resources providing responsive reserves"
2017,Supply/Demand,"there was , however , one automatic deployment of QQ1kltxlt1MQQ mw of frequency responsive load on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Supply/Demand,"in QQyearQQ , the total amount of responsive reserves procured by ercot varied between 2,300 mw and 2,808 mw per hour"
2017,Supply/Demand,"during QQyearQQ , there were no system - wide manual or automatic deployments of load resources providing responsive reserve service"
2017,Supply/Demand,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ below shows the average amount of responsive reserves provided from load resources on a daily basis for the past three years
2017,Supply/Demand,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / demand and supply figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : daily average of responsive reserves provided by load resources 2,400 self ‐ scheduled market procured offer not ‐ accepted 2,100 load resources are limited to providing no more than QQltxlt100QQ % of responsive reserves 1,800 responsive reserves ( mw ) 1,500 1,200 QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQxlt1QQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ am QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ a QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ load resources are limited to providing a maximum of QQltxlt100QQ % of responsive reserves and the quantity of offers submitted by load resources exceeded the limit most of the time in QQyearQQ"
2017,Supply/Demand,one exception is when real - time prices are expected to be high
2017,Supply/Demand,"because load resources provide capacity by reducing consumption , they have to be consuming energy to be eligible to provide the service"
2017,Supply/Demand,during periods of expected high prices the price paid for energy can exceed the value received from providing responsive reserves
2017,Supply/Demand,reduced offer quantities observed during the spring and fall months QQmonthQQ reflect the lack of availability of load resources due to annual maintenance at some of the larger load resource facilities
2017,Supply/Demand,the significant reduction in offers from load resources observed in late QQmonthQQ and early QQmonthQQ is caused by the effects of hurricane harvey interrupting industrial processes along the gulf coast
2017,Supply/Demand,"ercot protocols also permit load resources to provide non - spinning reserves and regulation services , but for a variety of reasons , load resources have participated only minimally in providing these services"
2017,Supply/Demand,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report demand and supply reliability programs there are two main reliability programs in which demand can participate in ercot – emergency response service ( ers ) and load management programs offered by the transmission and distribution utilities
2017,Supply/Demand,the ers program is defined by a puct rule enacted in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ setting a program budget of $ QQltxlt100QQ million
2017,Supply/Demand,"QQltxlt100QQ the program was modified from a pay - as - bid auction to a clearing price auction in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , providing a clearer incentive to load to submit offers based on the costs to curtail , including opportunity cost"
2017,Supply/Demand,"in QQyearlag1QQ , the procurement for ers shifted from four time periods per contract term to six time periods per contract term"
2017,Supply/Demand,the additional time periods were created to separate the higher risk times of early morning and early evening from the overnight and weekend hours
2017,Supply/Demand,"the time and capacity - weighted average price for ers over the contract periods from QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ through QQmonthQQ QQyearlead1QQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , exactly the same outcome as the previous program year"
2017,Supply/Demand,this price is significantly higher than the average price of $ QQmonthdayQQ and $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh paid for non - spinning reserves in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearQQ
2017,Supply/Demand,ers was not deployed in either year
2017,Supply/Demand,"on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ , the public utility commission of texas adopted an amendment to QQmonthdayQQ tac § QQmonthdayQQ , permitting ers resources to participate in must run alternative ( mra ) arrangements to replace the need for reliability must run ( rmr ) generation resources"
2017,Supply/Demand,"QQltxlt100QQ beyond ers there were slightly more than QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw of load participating in load management programs administered by transmission and distribution utilities in QQyearQQ energy efficiency and peak load reduction programs are required under state law and puct rule and most commonly take the form of load management , where participants allow electricity to selected appliances ( typically air conditioners ) to be curtailed"
2017,Supply/Demand,these programs administered by transmission and distribution utilities QQmonthQQ be deployed by ercot during a level QQmonthdayQQ energy emergency alert ( eea )
2017,Supply/Demand,"self - dispatch in addition to active participation in the ercot market and ercot - dispatched reliability programs , loads in ercot can observe system conditions and reduce consumption accordingly"
2017,Supply/Demand,this response comes in two main forms
2017,Supply/Demand,the first is by participating in programs administered by competitive retailers or third parties to provide shared benefits of load reduction with end - use customers
2017,Supply/Demand,the second is through actions taken to avoid the allocation of transmission costs
2017,Supply/Demand,"of these two methods , the more significant impacts are related to actions taken to avoid the allocation of transmission costs"

2017,Supply/Demand,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / demand and supply for decades , transmission costs have been allocated on the basis of load contribution to the highest QQmonthdayQQ - minute system demand during each of the four months from QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ"
2017,Supply/Demand,"this allocation mechanism is routinely referred to as four coincident peak , or 4cp"
2017,Supply/Demand,"by reducing demand during peak periods , load entities seek to reduce their share of transmission charges"
2017,Supply/Demand,"transmission costs have doubled since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , increasing an already substantial incentive to reduce load during probable peak intervals in the summer"
2017,Supply/Demand,QQltxlt100QQ ercot estimates that as much as QQ1kltxlt1MQQ mw of load were actively pursuing reduction during the 4cp intervals in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearQQ load curtailment to avoid transmission charges QQmonthQQ be distorting prices during peak demand periods because the response is targeting peak demand rather than responding to wholesale prices
2017,Supply/Demand,"this was readily apparent in QQyearlag1QQ as there were significant load curtailments corresponding to peak load days in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ when real - time prices on those days were in the range of $ QQmonthdayQQ to $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh"
2017,Supply/Demand,"the trend continued in QQyearQQ , with significant load curtailments on peak load days in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ when real - time prices were less than $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per mwh"
2017,Supply/Demand,two recent changes in the ercot market continue to advance appropriate pricing actions taken by load in the real - time energy market
2017,Supply/Demand,"first , the initial phase of “ loads in sced ” was implemented in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , allowing controllable loads that can respond to QQmonthdayQQ - minute dispatch instructions to specify the price at which they no longer wish to consume"

2017,Reliability,reliability commitments v
2017,Reliability,reliability commitments one of the important characteristics of any electricity market is the extent to which it results in the efficient commitment of generating resources
2017,Reliability,"under - commitment can cause apparent shortages in the real - time market and inefficiently high energy prices , while over - commitment can result in excessive start - up costs , uplift charges , and inefficiently low energy prices"
2017,Reliability,the ercot market does not include a mandatory centralized unit commitment process
2017,Reliability,the decision to start - up or shut - down a generator is made by the market participant
2017,Reliability,"ercot’s day - ahead market informs these decisions , but is only financially binding"
2017,Reliability,"that is , when a generator’s offer to sell is selected ( cleared ) in the day - ahead market there is no corresponding requirement to actually start that unit"
2017,Reliability,the generator will be financially responsible for providing the amount of capacity and energy cleared in the day - ahead market whether or not the unit operates
2017,Reliability,this decentralized commitment depends on clear price signals to ensure an efficient combination of units are online and available for dispatch
2017,Reliability,"ercot , in its role as reliability coordinator , has the responsibility to commit units it deems necessary to ensure the reliable operation of the grid"
2017,Reliability,"gaps exist between what individual resources , in aggregate , view as economic commitment and what ercot views as necessary to ensure the reliability of the region"
2017,Reliability,"in the event of these gaps , ercot uses its discretion to commit additional units to ensure reliability"
2017,Reliability,"this section describes the evolution of rules and procedures regarding reliability unit commitments ( ruc ) , the outcomes of rucs , and the price mitigation that occurs during ruc and local congestion"
2017,Reliability,the section concludes with a discussion of the reliability must run ( rmr ) process revisions in ercot in QQyearQQ
2017,Reliability,a
2017,Reliability,history of ruc - related protocol changes the ruc process has undergone several modifications since the nodal market began in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ
2017,Reliability,the following changes were implemented in an effort to improve the commitment process and market outcomes associated with ruc
2017,Reliability,"in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , an offer floor was put in place for energy above the low - sustained limit ( lsl ) for units committed through ruc"
2017,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ initially , the ruc offer floor was set at the system - wide offer cap"
2017,Reliability,"the ruc offer floor was subsequently QQltxlt100QQ nprr435 , requirements for energy offer curves in the real time sced for generation resources committed in ruc , implemented on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2017,Reliability,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / reliability commitments adjusted to $ 1,000 per mwh41 and then to the current offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh"
2017,Reliability,QQltxlt100QQ resources committed through the ruc process receive a make - whole payment and forfeit market revenues through a “ clawback ” provision
2017,Reliability,"beginning on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , resources committed through the ruc process could forfeit the make - whole payments and waive the clawback charges , effectively self - committing and accepting the market risks associated with that decision"
2017,Reliability,QQltxlt100QQ this buyback or “ opt - out ” mechanism for ruc requires a resource to update its current operating plan ( cop ) before the close of the adjustment period for the first hour of a ruc
2017,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag2QQ , ercot automated the ruc offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh and implemented the real - time on - line reliability deployment adder ( reliability adder )"
2017,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ ercot systems now automatically set the energy offer floor at $ 1,500 per mwh when a resource properly telemeters a status indicating it has received a ruc instruction"
2017,Reliability,"the reliability adder , as discussed more in section i : review of real - time market outcomes , captures the impact of reliability deployments such as ruc on energy prices"
2017,Reliability,the ruc process was modified again in QQyearQQ
2017,Reliability,"on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ , ercot began using a telemetered snapshot at the start of each ruc instruction block as the trigger to calculate the reliability adder"
2017,Reliability,"this was an improvement over the previous calculation trigger , which required the qualified scheduling entity ( qse ) to accurately telemeter an onruc status"
2017,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ to provide even greater flexibility , resources now have the ability to opt - out of ruc instructions given after the close of the adjustment period"
2017,Reliability,resources are also now permitted to opt out of ruc instructions via real - time telemetry ; opting out of a ruc instruction is available for resources that telemeter onoptout during the first sced - dispatchable interval within the first ruc - hour of the commitment block instruction
2017,Reliability,"during QQyearQQ , approximately QQmonthdayQQ % of ruc instructions were given after the close of the QQltxlt100QQ nprr568 , real - time reserve price adder based on operating reserve demand curve , implemented on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2017,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ nprr626 , reliability deployment price adder , partially - implemented to update the ruc offer floor on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2017,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ nprr416 , creation of the ruc resource buyback provision ( formerly “ removal of the ruc clawback charge for resources other than rmr units ” ) , as modified by nprr575 , clarification of the ruc resource buy - back provision for ancillary services"
2017,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ note that the process for electing to opt - out of a ruc will be based on real - time telemetry when nprr744 , ruc trigger for the reliability deployment price adder and alignment with ruc settlement , goes into effect in mid - QQyearQQ"

2017,Reliability,"ruc outcomes ercot continually assesses the adequacy of market participants ’ resource commitment decisions using the ruc process , which executes both on a day - ahead and hour - ahead basis"
2017,Reliability,"additional resources QQmonthQQ be determined to be needed for two reasons – to satisfy the total forecasted demand , or to make a specific generator available resolve a transmission constraint"
2017,Reliability,the transmission constraint QQmonthQQ be either a thermal limit or a voltage concern
2017,Reliability,the number of ruc instructions in QQyearQQ dropped considerably from QQyearlag1QQ
2017,Reliability,the QQ1kltxlt1MQQ unit - hours of ruc instructions in QQyearQQ represent a QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % decrease from QQ1kltxlt1MQQ unit - hours in QQyearlag1QQ
2017,Reliability,"these QQyearQQ ruc instructions were geographically diverse as well , with QQltxlt100QQ % to generators in the south zone in a variety of locations : san antonio , corpus christi and the rio grande valley ( the valley ) , QQltxlt100QQ % were to generators in the houston zone , QQmonthdayQQ % were to generators in the north zone , and the remaining QQmonthdayQQ % were to generators in the west zone"
2017,Reliability,"like QQyearlag1QQ , most reliability commitments in QQyearQQ were made primarily to manage transmission constraints in QQyearQQ ( QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of unit - hours ) , including QQmonthdayQQ % to manage congestion in the aftermath of hurricane harvey"
2017,Reliability,only QQmonthdayQQ % of ruc instructions were made to ensure sufficient system - wide capacity and QQmonthdayQQ % for voltage support
2017,Reliability,"the ruc activity in previous years was driven by a variety of other factors ; in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , ruc activity was concentrated during cold weather events in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ and in response to transmission outages in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ"
2017,Reliability,"in QQyearlag2QQ , rucs were most frequent in the fall because of congestion in dallas and the valley"
2017,Reliability,the high amount of ruc activity in QQyearlag1QQ was primarily for localized transmission congestion mainly to units located in houston and the valley
2017,Reliability,"although the total volume of ruc instructions was much lower in QQyearQQ compared to QQyearlag1QQ , the amount of ruc instructions for system - wide capacity was greater in QQyearQQ"
2017,Reliability,"there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unit - hours of ruc instructions to ensure system - wide adequacy , which represents QQmonthdayQQ % of the total in QQyearQQ"
2017,Reliability,"in QQyearlag1QQ , there were QQltxlt100QQ unit - hours , representing QQmonthdayQQ % of the total"
2017,Reliability,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ below shows ruc activity by month , indicating the volume of generators receiving a ruc instruction that had offers in the day - ahead market or chose to opt - out of the ruc instruction"

2017,Reliability,"however , if the energy payments received by a unit operating under a ruc instruction exceed its operating costs , payment to that generator is reduced ( ruc clawback charge )"
2017,Reliability,"generators without offers submitted to the day - ahead market forfeit all excess revenues , whereas generators with day - ahead offers forfeit only QQltxlt100QQ % of excess revenues"
2017,Reliability,"given this incentive to have offers submitted into the day - ahead market , it is somewhat surprising that all units do not submit day - ahead offers"
2017,Reliability,"in QQyearQQ , only QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of the generators receiving ruc instructions had day - ahead offers , a relatively low percentage considering the incentive to provide day - ahead offers inherent in the ruc claw - back rules"
2017,Reliability,this low percentage was still an increase from QQyearlag1QQ when the ratio was QQltxlt100QQ %
2017,Reliability,this QQmonthQQ indicate that some reduction in the ruc activity in QQyearQQ was due to a larger share of the units needed for reliability being committed through the day - ahead market
2017,Reliability,"since QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , a generator receiving a ruc instruction has had the choice to “ opt out , ” meaning it forgoes all ruc make - whole payments in return for not being subject to ruc clawback charges"
2017,Reliability,"the percentage of generators receiving ruc instructions in QQyearQQ that chose to opt - out was QQmonthdayQQ % , similar to the QQltxlt100QQ % of generators that chose to opt - out in QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Reliability,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report reliability commitments during the first half of QQyearQQ , qse telemetry of a generator’s ruc status served as the trigger for calculating a reliability adder"
2017,Reliability,there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ hours in which units were settled as ruc in QQyearQQ and QQ100ltxlt1kQQ hours of pricing intervals with non - zero reliability adders that occurred coincident with a settled ruc hour

2017,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows that the monthly average magnitude of ruc generation increased in QQyearQQ compared to the prior two years
2017,Reliability,this figure shows that the average quantity dispatched during most months of QQyearQQ exceeded QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw
2017,Reliability,"in QQmonthQQ , the average dispatch level was QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw because of a number of large generators receiving ruc instructions for a brief period"
2017,Reliability,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / reliability commitments figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : reliability unit commitment capacity units committed for ruc in QQyearQQ showed a significant increase in the dispatch level compared to prior years
2017,Reliability,"in QQmonthdayQQ % of intervals with ruc resources , one or more resources were dispatched above their low dispatchable limit ( ldl ) , whereas in prior years , resources receiving a ruc were infrequently dispatched above ldl"
2017,Reliability,"this higher dispatch level indicates that most units receive ruc instructions to resolve local constraints , and that these local constraints are non - competitive"
2017,Reliability,"as a result , units receive payment based on their mitigated offer caps"
2017,Reliability,"it is rare for a generator receiving a ruc instruction to be dispatched above ldl with their offer above the $ 1,500 per mwh offer floor and it did not occur during QQyearQQ"
2017,Reliability,"when a unit is committed for ruc , the unit will receive a make - whole payment if the real - time revenues are less than the costs incurred to commit the unit"
2017,Reliability,these costs can be based on generic values or unit - specific verifiable costs
2017,Reliability,"of the QQltxlt100QQ different resources that received a ruc instruction in QQyearQQ , QQltxlt100QQ resources had approved unit - specific verifiable costs for start - up costs and minimum load costs"
2017,Reliability,those QQltxlt100QQ resources represent QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of total ruc - instructed megawatt - hours in QQyearQQ
2017,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ displays the total annual amount of make - whole payments and clawback charges attributable to rucs for QQyearlag2QQ - QQyearQQ
2017,Reliability,there are two sources of funding for ruc make - whole QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report reliability commitments payments
2017,Reliability,the first is from qses that do not provide enough capacity to meet their obligations
2017,Reliability,"if there are remaining ruc make - whole funds required after contributions from any capacity short qses , any remaining ruc make - whole funding will be uplifted to all qses on a load - ratio share"

2017,Reliability,"during QQyearQQ , $ QQmonthdayQQ million was clawed back from ruc units while only $ QQxlt1QQ million in make - whole payments were made to ruc units"
2017,Reliability,all ruc make - whole payments in QQyearQQ were collected from qses that were capacity short
2017,Reliability,the magnitude of both the clawback and make - whole amounts are very small compared to the size of the ercot real - time energy market
2017,Reliability,one of the important characteristics of any electricity market is the extent to which it results in the efficient commitment of generating resources
2017,Reliability,"under - commitment can cause apparent shortages in the real - time market and inefficiently high energy prices ; while over - commitment can result in excessive start - up costs , uplift charges , and inefficiently low energy prices"

2017,Reliability,"as shown in the figure below , the amount of capacity committed in advance of the operating hour for QQyearQQ was greater than in QQyearlag1QQ , but much less than in QQyearlag2QQ"
2017,Reliability,"in QQyearlag2QQ , on average , about QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw of capacity was committed in the last hour before real time"
2017,Reliability,"in QQyearlag1QQ , the amount increased to over QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw , with even larger deficiencies seen in the last hours leading up to real time"

2017,Reliability,"mitigation in situations where competitive forces are not sufficient , it can be necessary to mitigate prices to a level that approximates competitive outcomes"
2017,Reliability,ercot’s real - time market includes a mechanism to mitigate prices for resources that are required to resolve a transmission constraint
2017,Reliability,mitigation applies whether the unit is self - committed or receives a ruc instruction
2017,Reliability,"units typically received a ruc instruction to resolve transmission constraints and as such they are typically required to resolve a transmission constraint , and therefore mitigated"
2017,Reliability,"as shown previously in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ , units that received a ruc instruction were frequently dispatched above their low operating limits in QQyearQQ"
2017,Reliability,"this higher dispatch was due to the ruc units being dispatched based on their mitigated price , not the ruc offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh"
2017,Reliability,"ercot’s dispatch software includes an automatic , two - step price mitigation process"
2017,Reliability,"in the first step , the dispatch software calculates output levels ( base points ) and associated locational marginal prices using the participants ’ offer curves and considers only the transmission constraints that have been deemed competitive"
2017,Reliability,"these “ reference prices ” at each generator location are compared with that generator’s mitigated offer cap , and the higher of the two is used to formulate the offer curve to be used for that generator in the second step in the dispatch process"
2017,Reliability,"the resulting mitigated offer curve is used by the dispatch software to determine the final output levels for each generator , taking all transmission constraints into consideration"
2017,Reliability,this approach is intended to limit the ability of a generator to raise prices in the event of a transmission constraint that requires its output to resolve
2017,Reliability,in this subsection the quantity of mitigated capacity in QQyearQQ is analyzed
2017,Reliability,"although executing at all times , the automatic price mitigation aspect of the two - step dispatch process only has the potential to have an effect when a non - competitive transmission constraint is active"
2017,Reliability,"with the introduction of an impact test in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ to determine whether units are relieving or contributing to a transmission constraint , only the relieving units are now subject to mitigation"
2017,Reliability,this change has significantly reduced the amount of capacity subject to mitigation

2017,Resource Adequacy,resource adequacy one of the primary functions of the wholesale electricity market is to provide economic signals that will facilitate the investment needed to maintain a set of resources that are adequate to satisfy the system’s needs
2017,Resource Adequacy,this section begins with an evaluation of these economic signals by estimating the “ net revenue ” resources received from ercot real - time and ancillary services markets and providing comparisons to other markets
2017,Resource Adequacy,"next , the effectiveness of the scarcity pricing mechanism is reviewed"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the current estimate of planning reserve margins for ercot and other regions are presented , followed by a description of the factors necessary to ensure resource adequacy in an energy - only market design"
2017,Resource Adequacy,a
2017,Resource Adequacy,net revenue analysis net revenue is calculated by determining the total revenue that could have been earned by a generating unit less its variable production costs
2017,Resource Adequacy,"put another way , it is the revenue in excess of short - run operating costs that is available to recover a unit’s fixed and capital costs , including a return on the investment"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in ercot’s energy - only market , the net revenues from the real - time energy and ancillary services markets alone provide the economic signals that inform suppliers ’ decisions to invest in new generation or retire existing generation"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"to the extent that revenues are available through the day - ahead market or other forward bilateral contract markets , these revenues are ultimately derived from the expected real - time energy and ancillary service prices"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"although most suppliers are likely to receive the bulk of their revenues through bilateral contracts , the spot prices produced in the real - time energy market should drive bilateral energy prices over time and thus are appropriate to use for this evaluation"
2017,Resource Adequacy,it is important to note that this net revenue calculation is a look back at the estimated contribution based on actual market outcomes
2017,Resource Adequacy,suppliers will typically base investment decisions on expectations of future electricity prices
2017,Resource Adequacy,"although expectations of future prices should be informed by history , they will also factor in the likelihood of shortage pricing conditions that could be very different than what actually occurred"
2017,Resource Adequacy,the energy net revenues are computed based on the generation - weighted settlement point prices from the real - time energy market
2017,Resource Adequacy,"weighting the energy values in this way facilitates comparisons between geographic zones , but will mask what could be very high values for a specific generator location"
2017,Resource Adequacy,this analysis does not consider any payments for potential ruc actions
2017,Resource Adequacy,the analysis necessitates reliance on simplifying assumptions that can lead to over - estimates of the profitability of operating in the wholesale market
2017,Resource Adequacy,start - up costs and minimum running times are not accounted for in the net revenue analysis
2017,Resource Adequacy,"ramping restrictions , which can prevent generators from profiting during brief price spikes , are also excluded"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"but despite these limitations , the net revenue analysis provides a useful summary of signals for investment in the wholesale market"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy for purposes of this analysis , the following assumptions were used for natural gas units : heat rates of QQmonthdayQQ mmbtu per mwh for a combined cycle unit , QQmonthdayQQ mmbtu per mwh for a combustion turbine , and $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in variable operating and maintenance costs"
2017,Resource Adequacy,a total outage rate ( planned and forced ) of QQmonthdayQQ % was assumed for each technology
2017,Resource Adequacy,net revenue is calculated by assuming the unit will produce energy in any hour for which it is profitable and by assuming it will be available to sell reserves and regulation ( combined cycle units only ) in all other hours
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the next two figures provide an historical perspective of the net revenues available to support investment in a new natural gas combustion turbine ( figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ) and combined cycle generation ( figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ) , selected to represent the marginal new supply that QQmonthQQ enter when new resources are needed"
2017,Resource Adequacy,values for the west zone are excluded because historically lower energy prices make it a less attractive location to site natural gas generation
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the figure also shows the estimated “ cost of new entry , ” which represents the revenues needed to break even on the investment"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : combustion turbine net revenues based on estimates of investment costs for new units , the net revenue required to satisfy the annual fixed costs ( including capital carrying costs ) of a new combustion turbine unit ranges QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report resource adequacy from $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the ercot market continued to provide net revenues well below the level needed to support new investment , ranging from below $ QQmonthdayQQ per kw - year in the north zone to almost $ QQltxlt100QQ per kw - year in houston"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : combined cycle net revenues for a new combined cycle natural gas unit , the estimate of net revenue requirement is approximately $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the net revenue in QQyearQQ for a new combined cycle unit was calculated to be approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year , depending on the zone"
2017,Resource Adequacy,these values are well below the estimated cost of new combined cycle generation
2017,Resource Adequacy,"these results are consistent with continued surplus of capacity , which contributed to infrequent shortages over the past three years"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in an energy - only market , shortages play a key role in delivering the net revenues an investor needs to recover its investment"
2017,Resource Adequacy,such shortages will tend to be clustered in years with unusually high load or poor generator availability
2017,Resource Adequacy,"hence , these results alone do not raise substantial concern regarding design or operation of ercot’s operating reserve demand curve ( ordc ) mechanism for pricing shortages"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"given the recent generation retirements and continued load growth , QQyearlead1QQ QQmonthQQ well be a year with significantly more occurrences of shortage pricing"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy given the low natural gas and resulting energy prices in QQyearQQ , the economic viability of existing coal and nuclear units was evaluated"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"non - shortage prices , which have been substantially affected by the prevailing natural gas prices , determine the vast majority of net revenues received by these base load units"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"as previously described , the load - weighted ercot - wide average energy price in QQyearQQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh"
2017,Resource Adequacy,the generation - weighted average price for the four nuclear units in ercot ( approximately QQmonthdayQQ gw of capacity ) was lower at $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh
2017,Resource Adequacy,"this is similar to nuclear prices in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearlag2QQ , which were also lower than the ercot - wide prices in those years"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"nuclear prices were $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ , down from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag2QQ"
2017,Resource Adequacy,table QQmonthdayQQ displays the calculated output - weighted price by generation type
2017,Resource Adequacy,table QQmonthdayQQ : settlement point price by fuel type output - weighted generation type price coal $ QQmonthdayQQ combined cycle $ QQmonthdayQQ gas peakers $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ gas steam $ QQltxlt100QQ hydro $ QQmonthdayQQ nuclear $ QQmonthdayQQ power storage $ QQltxlt100QQ private network $ QQmonthdayQQ renewable $ QQmonthdayQQ solar $ QQmonthdayQQ wind $ QQmonthdayQQ assuming that operating costs in ercot are similar to the u.s
2017,Resource Adequacy,"average , it is likely that these units were not profitable in QQyearQQ based on the fuel and operating and maintenance costs alone"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"hence , it is unlikely that these nuclear units covered any capital costs that QQmonthQQ have been incurred"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"however , unlike other regions with large amounts of nuclear generation , the four nuclear units in ercot are relatively new and owned by four entities with sizable load QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report resource adequacy obligations"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"although not profitable on a stand - alone basis , the nuclear units have substantial option value for the owners because they ensure that their cost of serving their load will not rise substantially if natural gas prices increase"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"nonetheless , the economic pressure on these units does potentially raise a resource adequacy issue that will need to continue to be monitored"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the generation - weighted price of all coal and lignite units in ercot during QQyearQQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , an increase from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"although specific unit costs QQmonthQQ vary , index prices for powder river basin coal delivered to ercot were approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu in QQyearQQ ; returning to QQyearlag2QQ levels after decreasing to $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu in QQyearlag1QQ"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"during QQyearlag2QQ and QQyearlag1QQ , delivered coal costs in ercot were higher than natural gas prices at the houston ship channel , resulting in reduced market share for coal generation"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"with the increased natural gas prices in QQyearQQ , the spread between coal and natural gas increased to nearly $ QQxlt1QQ per mmbtu"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"however , given coal units generally have higher heat rates and more expensive non - fuel operations and maintenance costs , economic pressure remain"
2017,Resource Adequacy,during QQyearQQ one coal unit was seasonally mothballed and luminant declared its intention to retire seven other coal units in early QQyearlead1QQ
2017,Resource Adequacy,the imm reviewed each of these actions and found them to be supported by the unit specific financials
2017,Resource Adequacy,these results indicate that during QQyearQQ the ercot markets would not have provided sufficient revenues to support profitable investment in any of the types of generation technology evaluated
2017,Resource Adequacy,"as detailed in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ , QQyearQQ saw the highest level of non - renewable capacity additions since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , which QQmonthQQ seem inconsistent with the low levels of scarcity pricing present in the ercot market in recent years"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"however , the fact that new generation continues to be added in the ercot market can be explained by a number of factors"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"first , resource investments are driven primarily by forward price expectations"
2017,Resource Adequacy,historical net revenue analyses do not provide a view of the future pricing expectations that will spur new investment
2017,Resource Adequacy,"suppliers will develop their own view of future expected revenue and given the level to which prices will rise under shortage conditions , small differences in expectations about the frequency of shortage pricing can greatly influence revenue expectations"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"second , this analysis does not account for bilateral contracts"
2017,Resource Adequacy,the only revenues considered in the net revenue calculation are those that came directly from the ercot real - time energy and ancillary services markets in a specific year
2017,Resource Adequacy,some developers QQmonthQQ have bilateral contracts for unit output that would provide more revenue than the ercot market did in QQyearQQ
2017,Resource Adequacy,"given the level to which prices will rise under shortage conditions , buyers QQmonthQQ enter bilateral contracts to hedge against high shortage pricing"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"third , net revenues in any one year QQmonthQQ be higher or lower than an investor would require over the long term"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in QQyearQQ , shortages were again much less frequent than would be expected over the long term"
2017,Resource Adequacy,shortage revenues play a pivotal role in motivating investment in an energy - only market like ercot
2017,Resource Adequacy,"hence , in some years shortage pricing will be frequent and net revenues QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy QQmonthQQ substantially exceed the cost of entry , while in most others it will be less frequent and net revenue will be less than the cost of entry"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"finally , the costs of new entry used in this report are generic and reflective of the costs of a new unit on an undeveloped greenfield site"
2017,Resource Adequacy,they have been reduced somewhat to reflect the lower costs of construction in texas
2017,Resource Adequacy,"however , companies QQmonthQQ have opportunities to build generation at much lower cost than these estimates ; either by having access to lower cost equipment , or by adding the new unit to an existing site , or some combination of both"
2017,Resource Adequacy,financing structures and costs can vary greatly between suppliers and QQmonthQQ be improved to be lower than the generic financing costs assumed in the net revenue analysis
2017,Resource Adequacy,"to provide additional context for the net revenue results presented in this subsection , the net revenue in the ercot market for two types of natural gas generation technologies are compared with the net revenue that those technologies could expect in other wholesale markets"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ provides a comparison of net revenues for a hypothetical combustion turbine with an assumed heat rate of 10,500 mmbtu per mwh installed in ercot , miso , nyiso , and pjm"

2017,Resource Adequacy,revisions to QQmonthdayQQ tac § QQmonthdayQQ were adopted in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ that specified a series of increases to the ercot system - wide offer cap
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the last step went into effect on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag2QQ , increasing the system - wide offer cap to $ 9,000 per mwh"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"as shown in figure QQmonthdayQQ : duration of high prices on page QQmonthdayQQ , there have been very brief periods when energy prices rose to the cap since the system - wide offer cap was increased to greater than $ 3,000 per mwh , and none since QQyearlag2QQ"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the spm includes a provision termed the peaker net margin ( pnm ) that is designed to provide a fail - safe pricing measure , which if exceeded would cause the system - wide offer cap to be reduced"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"if the pnm for a year reaches a cumulative total of $ 315,000 per mw , the system - wide offer cap is then reduced to the higher of $ 2,000 per mwh or QQltxlt100QQ times the daily natural gas price index"
2017,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ pnm also serves as a simplified measure of the annual net revenue of a hypothetical peaking unit

2017,Resource Adequacy,concerns with the spm under the zonal market design were addressed in every state of the market report produced during that period
2017,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the implementation of the nodal market design , which included a power balance penalty curve , created the opportunity for real - time energy prices to systematically reflect the value of reduced reliability imposed under shortage conditions , regardless of submitted offers"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , the puct took another step toward improving resource adequacy signals by directing ercot to implement the ordc"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"as discussed in section i : review of real - time market outcomes , ordc is a shortage pricing mechanism that reflects the loss of load probability at varying levels of operating reserves multiplied by the value of lost load"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in the short time it has been in effect , ordc has had a small impact on real - time prices"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the zonal market design was not the problem per se , rather its reliance on high - priced offers to set high prices during periods of shortage was of concern"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy in QQmonthQQ QQyearlag2QQ , the puct signaled its interest in reviewing ordc “ in order to examine how it has functioned and whether there is a need for minor adjustments to improve its efficiency"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"” QQ100ltxlt1kQQ given the short time period with ordc in effect , it is difficult to evaluate whether adjustments are warranted"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"as previously discussed , shortages are generally clustered in periods when weather - dependent load is unusually high or generation availability is poor ; neither of which has occurred since the ordc was implemented"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the fact that responsive and regulating reserves are forced to be maintained ( held behind the high ancillary service limit ( hasl ) ) under the current market design will continue to be problematic , regardless of the ordc parameters that are selected"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"jointly optimizing all products would improve the utilization of ercot resources , ensure that shortage pricing only occurs when the system is actually short after fully utilizing its resources , and establish prices for each product that efficiently reflect its reliability value without the use of administrative caps and adders"

2017,Resource Adequacy,"these projections are noticeably lower than those developed since QQmonthQQ of last year , QQ100ltxlt1kQQ which is due in large part to the approximately QQmonthdayQQ gw of capacity taken offline by early QQyearlead1QQ , with an expectation that the reserve margin will continue to be below the existing target level of QQmonthdayQQ % for the foreseeable future"

2017,Resource Adequacy,"less efficient , uneconomic units are retiring in times of relatively low prices"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"of the eleven generation units scheduled to retire or mothball since the QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ cdr , eight of those units ( totaling approximately 4,500 mw ) were coal units"
2017,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the imm views the decisions to retire the coal units to be justified based on the operating history and estimated costs of continued operations
2017,Resource Adequacy,"similar to the forces that have led to the retirement of less efficient natural gas fueled steam units , the retirement of older , less efficient coal units is an expected market outcome"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"with expectations for future natural gas prices to remain relatively low , the economic pressure on coal units in ercot is not expected to subside any time soon"
2017,Resource Adequacy,this economic pressure will exist regardless of the future of environmental regulations that could require additional capital investment for existing coal units
2017,Resource Adequacy,the retirement of uneconomic generation should not be viewed as failure to provide resource adequacy
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in fact , facilitating efficient decisions by generators to retire uneconomic units is nearly as important as facilitating efficient decisions to invest in new resources"
2017,Resource Adequacy,the market will achieve both objectives by establishing good economic price signals
2017,Resource Adequacy,"even with low prices , there continues to be high interest in the ercot market from generation developers as evidenced by the amount of capacity under consideration for interconnection"
2017,Resource Adequacy,at the end of QQyearQQ there was more capacity in the various stages of interconnection evaluation than at the beginning of the year
2017,Resource Adequacy,"however , the composition of that capacity had changed with much more solar generation and reduced amounts of natural gas generation"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"because the surplus has now disappeared and shortages are likely to be more frequent in QQyearlead1QQ , the economic signals could change rapidly"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"these short - term market outcomes and price signals , as well as investors ’ response to these economic signals , will be monitored"
2017,Resource Adequacy,this response could cause the planning reserve margins to exceed the forecast shown in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ above

2017,Resource Adequacy,"ensuring resource adequacy one of the primary goals of an efficient and effective electricity market is to ensure that , over the long term , there is an adequate supply of resources to meet customer demand plus any required installed or planning reserves"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in a region like ercot , where customer requirements for electricity have been and are expected to continue to increase , even with growing demand response efforts , maintaining adequate supply requires capacity additions"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"to incent these additions the market design must provide revenues such that the marginal resource receives QQ100ltxlt1kQQ monticello units QQmonthdayQQ , QQmonthdayQQ , and QQmonthdayQQ , totaling 1,865 mw , to be retired on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlead1QQ ; sandow units QQmonthdayQQ and QQmonthdayQQ , totaling approximately 1,200 mw , to be retired on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlead1QQ ; big brown units QQmonthdayQQ and QQmonthdayQQ , totaling 1,208 mw , to be retired on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlead1QQ ; gibbons creek , a QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw unit seasonally mothballed in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ"

2017,Resource Adequacy,"in this context , “ economic ” includes both a return of and on capital investment"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"generators earn revenues from three sources : energy prices during non - shortage , energy prices during shortage and capacity payments"
2017,Resource Adequacy,the capacity payments generators receive in ercot are related to the provision of ancillary services
2017,Resource Adequacy,"ancillary service payments are a small contributor , approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ per kw - year"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"setting ancillary service payments aside , generator revenue in ercot is overwhelmingly derived from energy prices under both shortage and non - shortage conditions"
2017,Resource Adequacy,expectations for energy pricing under non - shortage conditions are the same regardless of whether payments for capacity exist
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in ercot , with no capacity payments available , the amount a generator QQmonthQQ receive from energy pricing under shortage conditions must be large enough to provide the necessary incentives for new capacity additions"
2017,Resource Adequacy,this will occur when energy prices are allowed to rise substantially during times when the available supply is insufficient to simultaneously meet both energy and minimum operating reserve requirements
2017,Resource Adequacy,"ideally , energy and reserve prices during shortages should reflect the diminished system reliability under these conditions , which is equal to the increased probability of “ losing ” ( not serving ) load times the value of the lost load"
2017,Resource Adequacy,allowing energy prices to rise during shortages mirrors the outcome expected if loads were able to actively specify the quantity of electricity they wanted and the price they would be willing to pay
2017,Resource Adequacy,"the energy - only market design relies exclusively on these relatively infrequent occurrences of high prices to provide the appropriate price signal for demand response and new investment , when required"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in this way , energy - only markets can provide price signals that will sustain a portfolio of resources to be used in real - time to satisfy the needs of the system"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"however , this portfolio QQmonthQQ not include enough capacity to meet a specified target quantity of planning reserves"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"faced with reduced levels of generation development activity coupled with increasing loads that resulted in falling planning reserve margins , in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and QQ1kltxlt1MQQ the puct devoted considerable effort deliberating issues related to resource adequacy"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , the puct commissioners directed ercot to move forward with implementing ordc , a mechanism designed to ensure effective shortage pricing when operating reserve levels decrease"
2017,Resource Adequacy,"over the long term , a co - optimized energy and operating reserve market will provide more accurate shortage pricing"
2017,Resource Adequacy,planning reserves should continue to be monitored to determine whether shortage pricing alone is leading to the desired level of planning reserves

2017,Analysis,"analysis of competitive performance in this section , market power is evaluated from two perspectives : structural ( does market power exist ) and behavioral ( have attempts been made to exercise it )"
2017,Analysis,market structure is examined by using a pivotal supplier analysis that indicates the frequency with which a supplier was pivotal at higher load levels
2017,Analysis,this section also includes a summary of the voluntary mitigation plans in effect during QQyearQQ
2017,Analysis,market participant conduct is evaluated by reviewing measures of physical and economic withholding
2017,Analysis,these withholding patterns are further examined relative to the level of demand and the size of each supplier’s portfolio
2017,Analysis,"based on these analyses , we find the overall performance of the ercot wholesale market to be competitive in QQyearQQ"
2017,Analysis,a
2017,Analysis,structural market power indicators the market structure is analyzed by using the residual demand index ( rdi )
2017,Analysis,"the rdi is used to measure the percentage of load that cannot be served without the resources of the largest supplier , assuming that the market could call upon all committed and quick - start capacity owned by other suppliers"
2017,Analysis,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ when the rdi is greater than zero , the largest supplier is pivotal ( i.e"
2017,Analysis,", its resources are needed to satisfy the market demand )"
2017,Analysis,"when the rdi is less than zero , no single supplier’s resources are required to serve the load if the resources of its competitors are available"
2017,Analysis,"the rdi is a useful structural indicator of potential market power , although it is important to recognize its limitations"
2017,Analysis,"as a structural indicator , it does not illuminate actual supplier behavior to indicate whether a supplier QQmonthQQ have exercised market power , or whether it would have been profitable for a pivotal supplier to exercise market power"
2017,Analysis,"nonetheless , it does identify conditions under which a supplier could raise prices significantly by withholding resources"

2017,Analysis,"this is expected because at high load levels , the largest suppliers are more likely to be pivotal as other suppliers ’ resources are more fully utilized serving the load"
2017,Analysis,there was a noticeable decrease in the percentage of time with a pivotal supplier at loads below 50gw in QQyearQQ
2017,Analysis,"this led to a decrease in the pivotal supplier frequency to QQmonthdayQQ % of the time in QQyearQQ , down from QQmonthdayQQ % and QQmonthdayQQ % of all hours in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearlag2QQ , respectively"
2017,Analysis,"even with the slight decrease , market power continues to be a potential concern in ercot and underscores the need for effective mitigation measures to address it"
2017,Analysis,inferences regarding market power cannot be made solely from pivotal supplier data
2017,Analysis,bilateral and other financial contract obligations can affect a supplier’s potential market power
2017,Analysis,"for example , a small supplier selling energy only in the real - time energy market QQmonthQQ have a much greater incentive to exercise market power than a large supplier with substantial long - term sales contracts"
2017,Analysis,"the rdi measure shown in the previous figures do not consider the contractual position of the supplier , which can increase a supplier’s incentive to exercise market power compared to the load - adjusted capacity assumption made in this analysis"
2017,Analysis,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / competitive performance it should be noted that the analysis above evaluates the structure of the entire ercot market
2017,Analysis,"in general , local market power in narrower areas that can become isolated by transmission constraints raise more substantial competitive concerns"
2017,Analysis,"as more fully discussed in section v , reliability commitments , this local market power is addressed through : ( a ) structural tests that determine “ non - competitive ” constraints that can create local market power ; and ( b ) the application of limits on offer prices in these areas"
2017,Analysis,voluntary mitigation plans voluntary mitigation plans ( vmps ) existed for four market participants in QQyearQQ
2017,Analysis,generation owners are motivated to enter into vmps because adherence to a plan approved by the puct constitutes an absolute defense against an allegation of market power abuse through economic withholding with respect to behaviors addressed by the plan
2017,Analysis,this increased regulatory certainty afforded to a generation owner regarding its energy offers in the ercot real - time market must be balanced by appropriate protections against a potential abuse of market power in violation of pura § QQltxlt100QQ ( a ) and QQmonthdayQQ tac § QQmonthdayQQ ( g ) ( QQmonthdayQQ )
2017,Analysis,vmps should promote competitive outcomes and prevent abuse of market power through economic withholding in the ercot real - time energy market
2017,Analysis,the same restrictions are not required in forward energy markets ( e.g
2017,Analysis,", the ercot day - ahead market ) because the prices in forward energy markets are derived from the real - time energy prices"
2017,Analysis,"because forward energy markets are voluntary and the market rules do not inhibit arbitrage between the forward energy markets and the real - time energy market , competitive outcomes in the real - time energy market serve to discipline the potential abuse of market power in the forward energy markets"
2017,Analysis,"by the end of QQyearQQ , the four market participants with approved vmps were calpine , nrg , luminant and exelon"
2017,Analysis,"calpine’s vmp was approved in QQmonthQQ of QQ1kltxlt1MQQ because its generation fleet consists entirely of natural gas fueled combined cycle units , the details of the calpine plan are somewhat different than the others"

2017,Analysis,"however , all four vmps contain a requirement that these offers , if offered in any hour of an operating day , must be offered in the same price and quantity pair for all hours of the operating day"
2017,Analysis,"this provision , along with the quantity limitations , significantly reduces the potential that the vmps will allow market power to be exercised"

2017,Analysis,evaluation of supplier conduct the previous subsection presented a structural analysis that supports inferences about potential market power
2017,Analysis,this subsection provides the results of evaluating actual participant conduct to assess whether market participants have attempted to exercise market power through physical or economic withholding
2017,Analysis,"first , unit deratings and forced outages are examined to detect physical withholding"
2017,Analysis,"this is followed by an evaluation of the “ output gap , ” used to detect economic withholding"
2017,Analysis,"in a single - price auction like the real - time energy market , suppliers QQmonthQQ attempt to exercise market power by withholding resources"
2017,Analysis,"the purpose of withholding is to cause more expensive resources to set higher market clearing prices , allowing the supplier to profit on its other sales in the real - time energy market"
2017,Analysis,"because forward prices will generally be highly correlated with spot prices , price increases in the real - time energy market can also increase a supplier’s profits in the bilateral energy market"
2017,Analysis,this strategy is profitable only if the withholding firm’s incremental profit as a result of higher price is greater than the lost profit from the foregone sales of its withheld capacity
2017,Analysis,generation outages and deratings some portion of installed capacity is commonly unavailable because of generator outages and deratings
2017,Analysis,"because of limitations in outage data , the outage type must be inferred"
2017,Analysis,the outage type can be inferred by cross - referencing unit status information communicated to ercot with scheduled outage submissions
2017,Analysis,"if there is a corresponding scheduled outage , the unit is considered to be on a planned outage"
2017,Analysis,"if not , it is considered to be a forced outage"
2017,Analysis,the derated capacity is defined as the difference between the summertime maximum capacity of a generating resource and its actual capability as communicated to ercot on a continuous basis
2017,Analysis,it is very common for generating capacity to be partially derated because the resource cannot achieve its installed capacity level because of technical or environmental factors ( e.g
2017,Analysis,", component equipment failures or ambient temperature conditions )"
2017,Analysis,wind generators rarely produce at the installed capacity rating because of variations in available wind input
2017,Analysis,because such a large portion of derated capacity is related to wind generation it is shown separately in the following evaluation of long - term and short - term deratings
2017,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows a breakdown of total installed capacity for ercot on a daily basis during QQyearQQ
2017,Analysis,this analysis includes all in - service and switchable capacity
2017,Analysis,from the total installed capacity the following are subtracted : ( a ) capacity from private networks not available for export to the ercot grid ; ( b ) wind capacity not available because of the lack of wind input ; ( c ) short - term deratings ; ( QQmonthQQ ) short - term planned outages ; ( e ) short - term forced outages ; and ( e ) long - term outages and deratings greater than QQmonthdayQQ days
2017,Analysis,what remains is the capacity available to serve load

2017,Analysis,"short - term planned outages were largest in the shoulder months of QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ , while smallest during the summer months , consistent with expectations"
2017,Analysis,"short - term forced outages and deratings had no discernable seasonal pattern , occurring throughout the year"
2017,Analysis,"the quantity of long - term ( greater than QQmonthdayQQ days ) unavailable capacity , peaked in QQmonthQQ at QQmonthdayQQ gw and dropped to below QQmonthdayQQ gw in late QQmonthQQ"
2017,Analysis,"in early QQmonthQQ , one of the comanche peak nuclear units experienced a long term forced outage lasting until early QQmonthQQ , driving the long - term unavailable capacity to just over QQmonthdayQQ gw"
2017,Analysis,unavailable capacity reduced to QQmonthdayQQ gw with the return to service of comanche peak unit QQmonthdayQQ before increasing to QQmonthdayQQ gw in QQmonthQQ
2017,Analysis,"with the exception of the impacts of the comanche peak outage , this pattern reflects the continued choice by generation owners to schedule long duration outages during the spring and fall so as to ensure the units are available during the high load summer season when the units have a higher likelihood of operating"
2017,Analysis,the next analysis focuses specifically on short - term planned outages and forced outages and deratings of non - wind units because these classes of outages and deratings are the most likely to QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report competitive performance be used to physically withhold units in an attempt to raise prices
2017,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the average magnitude of the outages and deratings lasting less than QQmonthdayQQ days for the year and for each month during QQyearQQ
2017,Analysis,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : short - term outages and deratings QQmonthdayQQ % deratings planned outages forced outages QQmonthdayQQ % percentage of capacity QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQxlt1QQ % QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows that total short - term deratings and outages were as large as QQmonthdayQQ % of installed capacity in QQmonthQQ , and averaged around QQmonthdayQQ % during the summer"
2017,Analysis,most of this fluctuation was due to anticipated planned outages
2017,Analysis,the amount of capacity unavailable during QQyearQQ averaged QQmonthdayQQ % of installed capacity
2017,Analysis,this is a slight increase from QQmonthdayQQ % experienced in QQyearlag1QQ and QQmonthdayQQ % experienced in QQyearlag2QQ
2017,Analysis,"excluded from this analysis was a lengthy forced outage of comanche peak unit QQmonthdayQQ , which occurred from early QQmonthQQ to mid - QQmonthQQ"
2017,Analysis,"including the effects of this long - term forced outage of this large unit increases the monthly forced outage rates in QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ to almost QQmonthdayQQ % , and raises the annual forced outage rate from QQmonthdayQQ % to approximately QQmonthdayQQ %"
2017,Analysis,"even with including the comanche peak outage , outages and deratings are lowest during the summer when load is expected to be highest is consistent with expectations in a competitive market"
2017,Analysis,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / competitive performance evaluation of potential physical withholding physical withholding occurs when a participant makes resources unavailable for dispatch that are otherwise physically capable of providing energy and that are economic at prevailing market prices
2017,Analysis,this can be done either by derating a unit or declaring it as forced out of service
2017,Analysis,"because generator deratings and forced outages are unavoidable , the goal of the analysis in this subsection is to differentiate justifiable deratings and outages from physical withholding"
2017,Analysis,physical withholding is tested for by examining deratings and outage data to ascertain whether the data are correlated with conditions under which physical withholding would likely be most profitable
2017,Analysis,the rdi results shown in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ and figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ indicate that the potential for market power abuse rises at higher load levels as the frequency of positive rdi values increases
2017,Analysis,"hence , if physical withholding is occurring , one would expect to see increased deratings and outages at the highest load levels"
2017,Analysis,"conversely , because competitive prices increase as load increases , deratings and outages in a market performing competitively will tend to decrease as load approaches peak levels"
2017,Analysis,suppliers that lack market power will take actions to maximize the availability of their resources because their output is generally most profitable in peak periods
2017,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the average relationship of short - term deratings and forced outages as a percentage of total installed capacity to real - time load levels for large and small suppliers during summer months
2017,Analysis,portfolio size is important in determining whether individual suppliers have incentives to withhold available resources
2017,Analysis,"hence , the patterns of outages and deratings of large suppliers can be usefully evaluated by comparing them to the small suppliers ’ patterns"
2017,Analysis,long - term deratings are not included in this analysis because they are unlikely to constitute physical withholding given the cost of such withholding
2017,Analysis,wind and private network resources are also excluded from this analysis because of the high variation in the availability of these classes of resources
2017,Analysis,the large supplier category includes the five largest suppliers in ercot
2017,Analysis,the small supplier category includes the remaining suppliers
2017,Analysis,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report competitive performance figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : outages and deratings by load level and participant size , QQmonthQQ - QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ % deratings QQmonthdayQQ % planned outages forced outages QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % percentage of capacity QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQxlt1QQ % large large large large large large large large large small small small small small small small small small QQmonthdayQQ ‐ QQmonthdayQQ QQmonthdayQQ ‐ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ ‐ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ ‐ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ ‐ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ ‐ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ‐ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ‐ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ > QQ100ltxlt1kQQ load level ( gw ) figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ suggests that as demand for electricity increases , all market participants tend to make more capacity available to the market by scheduling planned outages during low load periods"
2017,Analysis,"because small participants have less incentive to physically withhold capacity , the outage rates for small suppliers serves as a good benchmark for competitive behavior expected from the larger suppliers"
2017,Analysis,"as in the previous analyses , the lengthy forced outage of luminant’s comanche peak nuclear unit is excluded from the analysis shown in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ"
2017,Analysis,"if included , the effects of that outage would have approximately doubled the forced outage rates for large parties during the higher load periods"
2017,Analysis,the higher forced outage rate for large parties at the lowest load levels reflects the impacts of hurricane harvey
2017,Analysis,"setting these two issues aside because they raise no competitive concerns , outage and deration rates for large suppliers were less than those of the smaller suppliers in QQyearQQ"
2017,Analysis,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / competitive performance evaluation of potential economic withholding to complement the prior analysis of physical withholding , this subsection evaluates potential economic withholding by calculating an “ output gap"
2017,Analysis,” the output gap is the quantity of energy that is not being produced by online resources even though the output is economic to produce by a substantial margin given the real - time energy price
2017,Analysis,"a participant can economically withhold resources , as measured by the output gap , by raising its energy offers so as not to be dispatched"
2017,Analysis,a resource is evaluated for inclusion in the output gap when it is committed and producing at less than full output
2017,Analysis,energy not produced from a committed resource is included in the output gap if the real - time energy price exceeds that unit’s mitigated offer cap by at least $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh
2017,Analysis,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the mitigated offer cap serves as a proxy for the marginal production cost of energy from that resource
2017,Analysis,"before presenting the results of the output gap analysis , a description of ercot’s two - step dispatch software is required"
2017,Analysis,"in the first step , the dispatch software calculates output levels ( base points ) and associated locational marginal prices using the participants ’ offer curves and only considering transmission constraints that have been deemed competitive"
2017,Analysis,"these “ reference prices ” at each generator location are compared with the generator’s mitigated offer cap , and the higher of the two is used to formulate the offer curve for that generator during the second step in the dispatch process"
2017,Analysis,"the resulting mitigated offer curve is used by the dispatch software to determine the final output levels for each generator , taking all transmission constraints into consideration"
2017,Analysis,"if a market participant has sufficient market power , it might raise its offer in such a way to increase the reference price in the first step"
2017,Analysis,"although in the second step the offer appears to be mitigated , the market participant has still influenced the market price"
2017,Analysis,this output gap is measured by the difference between the capacity level on a generator’s original offer curve at the first step reference price and the capacity level on the generator’s cost curve at the first step reference price
2017,Analysis,"however , this output gap is only indicative because no output instructions are sent based on the first step"
2017,Analysis,it is only used to screen whether a market participant is withholding in a manner that QQmonthQQ influence the reference price
2017,Analysis,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ given the low energy prices since QQyearlag1QQ , the output gap margin has been reduced to $ QQmonthdayQQ for purposes of this analysis"

2017,Analysis,"as previously illustrated , even though the offer curve is mitigated there is still the potential for the mitigated offer curve to be increased as a result of a high first - step reference price being influenced by a market participant raising prices"
2017,Analysis,"similar to the previous analysis , figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ also shows very small quantities of capacity that would be considered part of this output gap"

2018,RTM,real - time market outcomes i
2018,RTM,"review of real - time market outcomes although only a small share of the power produced in ercot is transacted in the real - time market , real - time energy prices set the expectations for prices in the day - ahead market and bilateral forward markets where most transactions occur"
2018,RTM,"unless there are barriers preventing arbitrage of the prices between the real - time and forward markets , prices in the forward markets should be directly related to the prices in the real - time market ( i.e"
2018,RTM,", real - time prices and forward prices should converge over the long - run )"
2018,RTM,"hence , low prices in the real - time energy market will translate to low forward prices"
2018,RTM,"likewise , price spikes in the real - time energy market will increase prices in the forward markets"
2018,RTM,"because of the interaction between real - time and all forward prices , the importance of real - time prices to overall market performance is much greater than might be inferred from the proportion of energy actually paying real - time prices"
2018,RTM,this section evaluates and summarizes electricity prices in the real - time market during QQyearQQ
2018,RTM,a
2018,RTM,real - time market prices the first analysis evaluates the total cost of supplying energy to serve load in the ercot wholesale market
2018,RTM,"in addition to the costs of energy , loads incur costs associated with ancillary services and a variety of non - market based expenses referred to as “ uplift"
2018,RTM,"” an average “ all - in ” price of electricity has been calculated for ercot that is intended to reflect wholesale energy costs , as well as these additional costs"
2018,RTM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ summarizes changes in energy prices and other market costs by showing the all - in price of electricity , which is a measure of the total cost of serving load in ercot for QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ"
2018,RTM,the ercot - wide price in this figure is the load - weighted average of the real - time market prices from all zones
2018,RTM,ancillary services costs and uplift costs are divided by real - time load and shown on a per mwh basis
2018,RTM,QQmonthdayQQ ercot real - time prices include the effects of two energy price adders that are designed to improve real - time energy pricing when conditions warrant or when ercot takes out - of - market actions for reliability
2018,RTM,"although published energy prices include the effects of both adders , the operating reserve demand curve adder ( operating reserve adder ) and the reliability deployment price adder ( reliability adder ) are shown separately here from the energy price"
2018,RTM,the operating reserve adder was implemented in mid - QQ1kltxlt1MQQ to account for the value of reserves based on the probability of reserves falling below the minimum contingency level and the value of lost load
2018,RTM,the reliability adder was implemented in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ as a mechanism to ensure that reliability deployments do not distort the energy prices
2018,RTM,"the reliability adder is calculated using QQmonthdayQQ for this analysis uplift includes : reliability unit commitment settlement , operating reserve demand curve ( ordc ) settlement , revenue neutrality total , emergency energy charges , base point deviation payments , emergency response service ( ers ) settlement , black start service settlement , block load transfer settlement , and the ercot system administrative fee"

2018,RTM,the figure above indicates that natural gas prices continued to be a primary driver of energy prices
2018,RTM,"this correlation is expected in a well - functioning , competitive market because fuel costs represent the majority of most suppliers ’ marginal production costs"
2018,RTM,"because suppliers in a competitive market have an incentive to offer supply at marginal costs and natural gas is the most widely - used fuel in ercot , changes in natural gas prices should translate to comparable changes in offer prices"
2018,RTM,"the average natural gas price in QQyearQQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu , up approximately QQmonthdayQQ % from the QQyearlag1QQ average price of $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu"
2018,RTM,ercot average real - time energy prices increased over QQmonthdayQQ % from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ to $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh in QQyearQQ
2018,RTM,"as described later , increased shortage conditions in QQyearQQ compounded the effects of higher natural gas prices on higher real - time energy prices"
2018,RTM,the average real - time energy price in QQyearQQ included relatively small contributions from ercot’s energy price adders : $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh from the operating reserve adder and $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh from the reliability adder
2018,RTM,"these values were a departure , more fully explained later , from the levels seen in QQyearlag1QQ ; $ QQxlt1QQ and $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh , for reserve and reliability adder , respectively"

2018,RTM,more detailed studies show that almost all the rena uplift occurred in market hours when there was transmission congestion
2018,RTM,"the three factors contributing most to rena uplift in QQyearQQ were the settlement of day - ahead ptp obligations linked to options , network model differences between day - ahead market and real - time market , and load distribution factor inconsistencies between day - ahead and real - time market"
2018,RTM,"the amount of rena uplift associated with the settlement of day - ahead obligations linked to options was $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million , the uplift amount resulted from the inconsistencies of load distribution factors was $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million , and the uplift amount from the transmission model differences in day - ahead and real - time was approximately $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million"
2018,RTM,these uplifted values were offset by $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million in negative uplift related to the manual adjustments made to the clearing price of ptp obligations
2018,RTM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ above shows that rena uplift from the settlement of day - ahead ptp obligations linked to options , described as crr uplift , was relatively high in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ , and the uplift from transmission modelling differences was significant in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ"
2018,RTM,"it is worth noting that while the manual corrections of those ptp obligation awards in the day - ahead market usually generated a negative uplift for each month in QQyearQQ , the magnitude was significant in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ , which partially offset the larger uplifts resulting from the transmission system modelling differences in those three months"
2018,RTM,"uplift from the contributions of load distribution factor differences between day - ahead and real - time , described as ldf contribution , was positive for all the months in QQyearQQ , with the most notable contributions in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ"
2018,RTM,"the task of maintaining accurate and consistent load distribution factors across all markets is a difficult one , made more difficult in areas with large amounts of localized load growth"

2018,RTM,such relationship is consistent with expectations in ercot where natural gas generators predominate and tend to set the marginal price
2018,RTM,"the most noticeable exception occurred in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , when energy prices were affected by shortage conditions"
2018,RTM,"real - time prices in QQyearQQ also showed the impacts of increased scarcity , but they were not as large as in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"

2018,RTM,constraints on the ability to import generation led to the houston zone being the highest priced zone in QQyearlag2QQ and QQyearlag1QQ
2018,RTM,"in QQyearQQ , the houston zone exhibited the lowest prices due to the completion of the houston import transmission project"
2018,RTM,"although slightly narrower than in QQyearlag1QQ , price spreads QQmonthdayQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / real - time market outcomes were still noticeable across all zones in QQyearQQ because of higher natural gas prices and the increased impacts of transmission congestion"
2018,RTM,"for the first time since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , the west zone had the highest prices , primarily due to multiple localized real - time transmission constraints"
2018,RTM,west zone prices relative to the ercot average have varied through the years
2018,RTM,"prior to QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , west zone prices were lower than the ercot average because of a wind generation surplus resulting from export limitations"
2018,RTM,"between QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , load growth caused by higher oil and natural gas production activity resulted in localized import constraints and higher prices"
2018,RTM,"even as investment in transmission facilities continued , the amount of wind generation additions began to create export limitations and resulting lower prices beginning in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2018,RTM,that trend was reversed in QQyearQQ due to multiple real - time transmission constraints
2018,RTM,more details about the transmission constraints influencing zonal energy prices are provided in section iii : transmission congestion and congestion revenue rights
2018,RTM,another factor influencing zonal price differences is congestion revenue right ( crr ) auction revenue distributions
2018,RTM,"these are distributed to qualified scheduling entities ( qses ) representing load , based on a zonal and ercot - wide monthly load - ratio share"
2018,RTM,the crr auction revenues have the effect of reducing the total cost to serve load borne by a qse

2018,RTM,ordc impacts and prices during shortage conditions the operating reserve demand curve ( ordc ) is a scarcity pricing mechanism that reflects the loss of load probability ( lolp ) at varying levels of operating reserves multiplied by the deemed value of lost load ( voll )

2018,RTM,"once available reserve capacity drops to 2,000 mw , prices will rise to $ 9,000 per mwh for all the ordc curves"
2018,RTM,figure QQmonthdayQQ : winter and summer peak operating reserve demand curves the following two analyses illustrate the contributions of the operating reserve adder and the reliability adder to real - time prices
2018,RTM,"as described above in figure QQmonthdayQQ , the contributions of the energy price adders increased in QQyearQQ"
2018,RTM,"the first of the two adders , the operating reserve adder , is a shortage value intended to reflect the expected value of lost load given online and offline reserve levels"
2018,RTM,"figure QQmonthdayQQ shows the number of hours in which the adder affected prices , and the average price effect in these hours and all hours"
2018,RTM,"this figure shows that in QQyearQQ , the operating reserve adder had the largest impacts to price during QQmonthQQ"
2018,RTM,the contribution from the operating reserve adder in QQyearQQ was greater than in recent years due to slightly more frequent occurrences of shortage conditions
2018,RTM,"overall , the operating reserve adder contributed $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , or QQmonthdayQQ % to the annual average real - time energy price of $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh"
2018,RTM,the contribution from the operating reserve adder to real - time prices in QQyearQQ was larger than in previous years due to the overall lower levels of operating reserves resulting from the lower level of installed reserve capacity
2018,RTM,"the effects of the operating reserve adder are expected to vary substantially from year to year , QQmonthdayQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / real - time market outcomes and to have the largest effects when low supply conditions and unusually high load conditions occur together and result in sustained shortages"

2018,RTM,"absent this adder , prices will generally fall when these actions are taken"
2018,RTM,figure QQmonthdayQQ below shows the impacts of the reliability adder in QQyearQQ
2018,RTM,"when averaged across only the hours when the reliability adder was non - zero , the largest price impacts of the reliability adder occurred during a few hours on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ when multiple resources were issued ruc instructions for system capacity insufficiency"
2018,RTM,the largest impact to price from the reliability adder occurred in QQmonthQQ
2018,RTM,"frequent ruc instructions , primarily in the first half of the month , resulted in a positive reliability adder in more than QQ100ltxlt1kQQ hours , with a contribution to real - time price of $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh"
2018,RTM,"the reliability adder was non - zero for QQ100ltxlt1kQQ hours , or QQmonthdayQQ % of the time in QQyearQQ , most of which occurred in QQmonthQQ"
2018,RTM,the contribution from the reliability adder to the annual average real - time energy price was $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh
2018,RTM,the reliability adder had very little overall effect on market outcomes in QQyearQQ
2018,RTM,weaknesses in the implementation of the reliability deployment adder have been identified and were under review by stakeholders at the end of QQyearQQ
2018,RTM,"the primary flaw identified in the calculation method used to determine the reliability adder was that relaxing the low dispatch limit of all resources made the price adders higher , even when the ruc - instructed resource was QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQmonthdayQQ / real - time market outcomes dispatched above its low dispatch limit the pricing run"
2018,RTM,"the price adders fluctuated based on interval - to - interval changes in the system , including changes for resources that were not ruc - instructed"
2018,RTM,relaxing high and low dispatch limits of resources that were not ruc - instructed was intended to avoid ramp limitations that could exaggerate the pricing impacts of the out - of - market action
2018,RTM,"proposed changes to the calculation method of the reliability adder were discussed in QQyearQQ in nprr904 , revisions to real - time on - line reliability deployment price adder for ercot - directed actions related to dc ties"

2018,RTM,this figure shows that high prices occurred more frequently in QQyearQQ than in any previous year since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ
2018,RTM,"prices greater than $ 1,000 per mwh occurred in nearly QQmonthdayQQ hours over the entire year"
2018,RTM,"prices were between $ 3,000 and $ 4,499 for roughly half an hour in QQyearQQ , while there were also brief occurrences of prices between $ 5,000 and $ 6,999 and $ 7,000 and $ 8,999"

2018,DAM,"offers to sell can take the form of either a three - part supply offer , which allows sellers to reflect the unique financial and operational characteristics of a specific generation resource , or an energy - only offer , which is location specific but not associated with a generation resource"
2018,DAM,bids to buy are also location specific
2018,DAM,"in addition to the purchase and sale of power , the day - ahead market also includes ancillary services and point - to - point ( ptp ) obligations"
2018,DAM,ptp obligations allow parties to hedge the incremental cost of congestion between day - ahead and real - time operations
2018,DAM,"with the exception of the acquisition of ancillary service capacity , the day - ahead market is a financial market"
2018,DAM,"although all bids and offers are evaluated for the ability to reliably flow on the transmission network , there are no operational obligations resulting from the day - ahead market"
2018,DAM,"day - ahead transactions QQmonthQQ be made for a variety of reasons , including satisfying the participant’s own demand , managing risk by hedging the participant’s exposure to real - time prices or congestion , or arbitraging the real - time prices"
2018,DAM,"for example , load - serving entities can insure against the higher volatility of real - time market prices by purchasing in the day - ahead market"

2018,DAM,day - ahead market prices one indicator of market performance is the extent to which forward and real - time spot prices converge over time
2018,DAM,forward prices will converge with real - time prices when : ( QQmonthdayQQ ) there are low barriers to shifting purchases and sales between the forward and real - time markets ; and ( QQmonthdayQQ ) sufficient information is available to market participants to allow them to develop accurate expectations of future real - time prices
2018,DAM,"when these conditions are met , market participants can be expected to arbitrage predictable differences between forward prices and real - time spot prices by increasing net purchases in the lower priced market and increasing net sales in the higher priced market"
2018,DAM,"this improves the convergence of forward and real - time prices , which should lead to improved commitment of resources needed to satisfy the system’s real - time needs"
2018,DAM,"in this subsection , price convergence between the day - ahead and real - time markets is evaluated"

2018,DAM,"QQmonthdayQQ price convergence was evident in all months in QQyearQQ except QQmonthQQ , when day - ahead and real - time prices diverged sharply"
2018,DAM,smaller quantities of installed reserves for the summer of QQyearQQ led to expectations of more frequent shortage conditions and produced much higher day - ahead prices compared to recent experience
2018,DAM,these expectations for high prices were not manifested in real - time due to higher than usual resource availability
2018,DAM,"real - time energy prices in ercot are allowed to rise to levels that are much higher than in other organized electricity markets , which increases risk and would explain a higher day - ahead QQmonthdayQQ for example , if day - ahead prices are $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh on two consecutive days while real - time prices are $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh and $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh respectively , the absolute price difference between the day - ahead market and the real - time market would be $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh on both days , while the difference in average prices would be $ QQxlt1QQ per mwh"

2018,DAM,this occurs when real - time congestion is greater than day - ahead market congestion
2018,DAM,"in eight of twelve months , as well as for the year in total , the acquisition charges were less than the revenues received , implying that expectations of congestion as evidenced by day - ahead purchases were less than the actual congestion that occurred in real - time"

2018,DAM,market participants QQmonthQQ self - schedule ancillary services or have them purchased on their behalf by ercot
2018,DAM,"in general , the purpose of responsive and non - spinning reserves is to protect the system against unforeseen contingencies ( e.g"

2018,DAM,"ercot procures responsive reserves to ensure that the system frequency can quickly be restored to appropriate levels after a sudden , unplanned outage of generation capacity"
2018,DAM,"non - spinning reserves are provided from slower responding generation capacity , and can be deployed alone , or to restore responsive reserve capacity"
2018,DAM,"regulation reserves are capacity that QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / day - ahead market performance responds every four seconds , either increasing or decreasing as necessary to fill the gap between energy deployments and actual system load"
2018,DAM,"since QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , ercot has calculated the requirement for responsive reserves based on a variable hourly need"
2018,DAM,this requirement is determined and posted in advance for the year
2018,DAM,ercot procures non - spinning reserves such that the combination of non - spinning reserves and regulation up will cover QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of the calculated net load forecast error
2018,DAM,ercot will always procure a minimum quantity of non - spinning reserves greater than or equal to the largest generation unit during on - peak hours
2018,DAM,regulation is used to fill the gap between generation dispatched in each interval and the actual moment - to - moment requirements for generation
2018,DAM,"to the extent the generation dispatched each interval can better reflect expected moment - to - moment changes , the quantity of regulation deployed can be minimized"
2018,DAM,"the determination of the quantity of generation to be dispatched is affected by the QQmonthdayQQ - minute short - term load forecast , the deployment of regulation in the previous interval and estimates of actual unit ramping capabilities , factors which are routinely evaluated and adjusted"
2018,DAM,"at the very end of QQyearQQ , ercot began including a new factor in the determination of generation to be dispatched , the short - term ( QQmonthdayQQ - minute ) wind forecast"
2018,DAM,including this factor should serve to improve ercot’s dispatch of other generators and improve the efficiency of regulation deployments
2018,DAM,"after several years of declining quantities , total requirements for ancillary services increased in QQyearQQ"
2018,DAM,"the average total requirement in QQyearQQ was greater than 4,900 mw , an increase from the average total requirement of approximately 4,800 mw in QQyearlag1QQ and roughly equal to the QQyearlag2QQ requirements"
2018,DAM,the principal cause for the overall increase in ancillary services requirements in QQyearQQ was a larger responsive reserve requirement aimed at ensuring adequate online system inertia

2018,DAM,this means that market participants need not include expectations of forgone energy sales in their ancillary service capacity offers
2018,DAM,"because ancillary service clearing prices explicitly account for the opportunity costs of selling energy in the day - ahead market , ancillary service prices should generally be correlated with day - ahead energy prices"

2018,DAM,"figure QQltxlt100QQ shows that regulation up was spread fairly evenly , similar to responsive reserve providers , while figure QQltxlt100QQ shows that that regulation down had similar concentration to non - spinning reserves in QQyearQQ"
2018,DAM,"again , luminant had a dominant position in the provision of regulation down"
2018,DAM,its QQltxlt100QQ % share of the regulation down responsibility in QQyearQQ was higher than in recent years ( QQmonthdayQQ % in QQyearlag1QQ and QQmonthdayQQ % in QQyearlag2QQ )

2018,DAM,"between the time an ancillary service is procured and the time that it is needed , changes often occur that prompt a qse to move all or part of its ancillary service responsibility from one unit to another"
2018,DAM,these changes QQmonthQQ be due to a unit outage or to other changes in market conditions affecting unit commitment and dispatch
2018,DAM,"in short , qses with multiple units are continually reviewing and moving ancillary service requirements , presumably to improve the efficiency of ancillary service provision , at least from the qse’s perspective"
2018,DAM,moving ancillary service responsibility is assumed to be in the qse’s self - interest
2018,DAM,"when all ancillary services are continually reviewed and adjusted in response to changing market conditions , the efficiencies will flow to all market participants and be greater than what can be achieved by qses acting individually"
2018,DAM,the ercot market appropriately reflects the tradeoff between providing capacity for ancillary services versus providing energy in its co - optimized day - ahead market
2018,DAM,those same tradeoffs exist in real - time
2018,DAM,"until comprehensive , market - wide co - optimization is implemented , the ercot market will continue to be subject to the choices of individual qses"
2018,DAM,"these choices are likely to be in the qse’s best interest , and are not likely to lead to the most economic provision of energy and ancillary services for the market as a whole"
2018,DAM,"further , qses without large resource portfolios are effectively precluded from participating in ancillary service markets because of the replacement risk faced in having to rely on a supplemental ancillary services market ( sasm )"
2018,DAM,this replacement risk is substantial
2018,DAM,clearing prices for ancillary services procured in sasm are typically three to QQltxlt100QQ times greater than annual average clearing prices from the day - ahead market
2018,DAM,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / day - ahead market performance ercot currently uses sasms either to procure replacement ancillary service capacity when transmission constraints arise that make the capacity undeliverable , or when outages or limitations at a generating unit lead to failure to provide the ancillary service"
2018,DAM,a sasm QQmonthQQ also be opened if ercot changes its ancillary service plan ; this did not occur during QQyearQQ
2018,DAM,"a sasm was executed QQmonthdayQQ times in QQyearQQ , with sasm awards providing QQ100ltxlt1kQQ service - hours"
2018,DAM,"sasms were more frequent in QQyearQQ than in QQyearlag1QQ when sasms were executed QQmonthdayQQ times , with sasm awards replacing QQ100ltxlt1kQQ service - hours"
2018,DAM,figure QQltxlt100QQ below provides the aggregate quantity of each service - hour that was procured via sasm
2018,DAM,"the volume of service - hours procured via sasm over the year ( approximately 2,700 mws of service - hours ) is infinitesimal when compared to the total ancillary service requirement of nearly QQltxlt100QQ million mws of service - hours"

2018,DAM,"sasms were infrequent in QQyearQQ largely because of the dearth of ancillary service offers typically available throughout the operating day , limiting re - configuration opportunities"
2018,DAM,"the sasm procurement method , while offer - based , is inefficient and problematic and will be virtually eliminated when real - time co - optimization of energy and ancillary services is implemented"
2018,DAM,"real - time co - optimization of energy and ancillary services will not require resources to estimate opportunity costs , will eliminate the need for the sasm mechanism , and allow ancillary services to be continually shifted to the most efficient provider"
2018,DAM,"because co - optimization allows the real - time market far more flexibility to procure energy and ancillary services from online resources , it will also reduce ercot’s need to use ruc procedures to acquire ancillary services"
2018,DAM,"the greatest benefit will be to effectively handle situations where entities that had day - ahead ancillary service awards were unable to fulfill that commitment , e.g"
2018,DAM,because of a generator forced outage
2018,DAM,"thus , implementation of real - time co - optimization will provide benefits across the market in future years"
2018,DAM,"because ancillary services are not currently co - optimized with energy in the sasm , potential suppliers are required to estimate opportunity costs rather than have the auction engine calculate those costs directly"
2018,DAM,"as a result , resources that underestimate opportunity costs are inefficiently QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / day - ahead market performance preferred over resources that overestimate opportunity costs"
2018,DAM,"further , the need to estimate the opportunity costs , which change constantly and significantly over time as the energy price changes , provides a strong disincentive to sasm participation , contributing to the observed lack of sasm offers"
2018,DAM,the paucity of sasm offers frequently leaves ercot with two choices in response to ancillary service un - deliverability or failure to provide : ( QQmonthdayQQ ) use an out - of - market ancillary service procurement action with its inherent inefficiencies ; or ( QQmonthdayQQ ) operate with a deficiency of ancillary services with its inherent increased reliability risk
2018,DAM,"in addition to its other weaknesses , a sasm is only useful for replacing ancillary services as part of a forward - looking view of the grid conditions"
2018,DAM,"however , there are instances where the system is short ancillary services in real - time as per the resource details telemetered to ercot"
2018,DAM,figure QQltxlt100QQ depicts the percentage of hours in each month of QQyearQQ where there was an ercot - wide shortage in the respective ancillary service

2018,DAM,"again , this analysis is based on the telemetered status provided by the parties with the responsibility"
2018,DAM,regulation up and down shortages continued into QQmonthQQ in nearly QQltxlt100QQ % of the hours for both services
2018,DAM,"shortages of QQltxlt100QQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / day - ahead market performance responsive reserve occurred in more than QQmonthdayQQ % of the hours in every month , with the most frequent shortages occurring in QQmonthQQ during almost QQltxlt100QQ % of the hours"
2018,DAM,figure QQltxlt100QQ below shows the percentage of each month during which there was at least one qse - portfolio that did not provide the full amount of ancillary service it had the responsibility to provide
2018,DAM,"as before , a shortage is defined as greater than QQxlt1QQ mw of obligation not being provided for at least QQmonthdayQQ minutes out of an hour"

2018,DAM,ancillary service awards are made from the day - ahead market and are for a certain amount of capacity for a one - hour duration
2018,DAM,"to date , there is not a mechanism in place to reduce payment for ancillary service awards in situations when the qse has not fully met the award"
2018,DAM,"while some explanations for the pervasive shortages shown in this analysis ( such as the inability to register ancillary service trade agreements very close to real - time operations ) would not cause a net ercot shortage of reserves and thus are of little reliability concern , the persistent net shortage shown in figure QQltxlt100QQ QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQltxlt100QQ / day - ahead market performance demonstrates the significance of this issue"
2018,DAM,"one of the benefits of real - time co - optimization will be that responsibilities for providing ancillary services will be continually adjusted and updated in real - time , eliminating the need for sasms and for registering individual trades"

2018,Congestion,transmission congestion and crrs iii
2018,Congestion,transmission congestion and congestion revenue rights one of the most important functions of any electricity market is to manage the flows of power on the transmission network by not allowing additional power flow on transmission facilities that have reached their operating limits
2018,Congestion,actions taken to ensure operating limits are not violated are called congestion management
2018,Congestion,the effect of congestion management is to change the output level of one or more generators to reduce the amount of electricity flowing on any transmission facility nearing its operating limit
2018,Congestion,this leads to higher costs
2018,Congestion,this increase in more expensive generation and decrease in less expensive generation results in different prices at different nodes
2018,Congestion,the decision about which generator ( QQmonthQQ ) will vary its output is based on the generator’s energy offer curve and how much of its output will flow across the overloaded transmission element
2018,Congestion,this leads to the dispatch of the most efficient generation to reliably serve demand while providing locational marginal pricing reflective of the actions taken to ensure system security
2018,Congestion,"the locational difference in prices produced by congestion can provide challenges to parties that have transacted in long term power contracts ; namely , if the production point ( for a seller ) or consumption point ( for a purchaser ) is different from the contracted delivery point , the party is subject to the risk that the prices will be different when settled"
2018,Congestion,"congestion revenue rights ( crr ) markets enable parties to purchase the rights to those price differences in seasonal and monthly blocks , and thus achieve some level of price certainty"
2018,Congestion,"this section of the report summarizes transmission congestion in QQyearQQ , provides a review of the costs and frequency of transmission congestion in both the day - ahead and real - time markets , and concludes with a review of the activity in the crr market"
2018,Congestion,a
2018,Congestion,"summary of congestion the total congestion costs experienced in the ercot real - time market in QQyearQQ were $ QQmonthdayQQ billion , a QQmonthdayQQ % increase from the QQyearlag1QQ value"
2018,Congestion,a costly localized constraint in far west texas was the primary cause of the increased congestion on the yucca switch to basin QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines
2018,Congestion,this congestion was directly related to high loads associated with increased oil and gas production
2018,Congestion,"congestion occurred with roughly the same frequency in QQyearQQ as in QQyearlag1QQ , with only a slight increase in the number of binding intervals"
2018,Congestion,"all zones experienced increased congestion in QQyearQQ , though inter - zonal congestion decreased"
2018,Congestion,the decrease in inter - zonal congestion can be attributed to the completion of the houston transmission import project in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ
2018,Congestion,figure QQltxlt100QQ provides a comparison of the amount of time transmission constraints were active and binding for various load levels from QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ
2018,Congestion,this figure also indicates the average number of constraints in a real - time contingency analysis ( rtca ) execution for each load level
2018,Congestion,rtca is the process that evaluates the resulting flows on the transmission system under a large number of different contingency scenarios
2018,Congestion,a thermal constraint exists if the outage of a QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / transmission congestion and crrs transmission element ( contingency ) results in a flow higher than the rating of a different element
2018,Congestion,binding transmission constraints are those for which the dispatch levels of generating resources are altered in order to maintain transmission flows at reliable levels
2018,Congestion,the costs associated with this re - dispatch are the system’s congestion value and are included in nodal prices
2018,Congestion,"active transmission constraints are those that the dispatch software evaluated , but did not require a re - dispatch of generation"

2018,Congestion,higher congestion costs in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearQQ are explained in part by the increased frequency of constraints
2018,Congestion,the pattern of constraints by load level was different in QQyearQQ than in QQyearlag1QQ
2018,Congestion,"constraints in QQyearQQ , similar to QQyearlag2QQ , occurred more frequently during higher load levels"
2018,Congestion,real - time constraints were binding in QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of intervals with load in excess of QQ100ltxlt1kQQ gw
2018,Congestion,differences between QQyearQQ and QQyearlag1QQ appear in the gradual increase for both the frequency of binding constraints and the average number of rtca constraints as load levels increase
2018,Congestion,"this difference is explained by the reduced amount of time with an active generic transmission constraint ( gtc ) , most noticeably at lower load levels"
2018,Congestion,a gtc was active QQltxlt100QQ % of the time in QQyearQQ compared to QQltxlt100QQ % in QQyearlag1QQ
2018,Congestion,"gtcs are not derived from rtca , but rather are determined by off - line studies and their limits are typically determined prior to the operating day"
2018,Congestion,gtcs are used to ensure that the generation dispatch does not violate a transient or voltage stability condition
2018,Congestion,certain gtc limits are determined in real - time using voltage stability assessment or QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / transmission congestion and crrs transient stability assessment
2018,Congestion,"using these tools to continuously evaluate the north to houston , panhandle , laredo , and the rio grande valley import limits provides a more accurate limit than what was could be determined as part of the day - ahead process"

2018,Congestion,the QQyearQQ monthly profile is relatively unexpected because shoulder months usually have the highest congestion costs
2018,Congestion,shoulder months are when most transmission and generation outages for maintenance and upgrades occur
2018,Congestion,"the increased congestion in QQmonthQQ was due to cold weather conditions and higher than expected load conditions in the far west increased congestion costs in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ"
2018,Congestion,"all zones experienced an increase in price impacts in QQyearQQ , whereas ercot cross - zonal congestion decreased"
2018,Congestion,"the north to houston constraint was a significant contributor to ercot congestion in recent years , but the completion of the houston transmission import project in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ resulted in reduced congestion"
2018,Congestion,the largest contributor to congestion costs in QQyearQQ was the increased congestion in the west zone
2018,Congestion,this congestion was the result of the high load in the far west caused by oil and gas development activity in the permian basin
2018,Congestion,"transmission line outages related to the required inspection and repair of structures on facilities owned by electric transmission texas ( ett ) continued in QQyearQQ , and are expected to continue into the future"
2018,Congestion,"however , this activity had minimal impact on west zone congestion compared to the impacts of load growth in the permian basin"

2018,Congestion,real - time constraints the review of real - time congestion begins with describing the areas with the highest financial impact from congestion
2018,Congestion,"for this discussion , a congested area is determined by consolidating multiple real - time transmission constraints that are determined to be similar because of geographic proximity and constraint direction"
2018,Congestion,"there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unique constraints that were binding at some point during QQyearQQ , with a median financial impact of approximately $ 177,000"
2018,Congestion,"in QQyearlag1QQ , there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unique constraints with a median financial impact of $ 235,000"
2018,Congestion,the location of the constraints around load areas contributed to higher congestion costs in QQyearQQ

2018,Congestion,the majority of the congestion value was generated on the line between yucca switch to gas pad
2018,Congestion,the gas pad to basin segment only incurred $ QQmonthdayQQ million of congestion cost
2018,Congestion,the congestion cost associated with yucca switch to gas pad in QQyearQQ was almost double the most costly constraint in QQyearlag1QQ
2018,Congestion,"this constraint and the seventh most valued constraint on this list , the pig creek area , are discussed in detail later in the permian basin subsection"
2018,Congestion,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / transmission congestion and crrs the second most costly constraint in QQyearQQ was the lewisville area , which is north of dallas - fort worth"
2018,Congestion,"the components of this constraint include the lakepoint to carrollton northwest , the west tnp to ti tnp , and the lewisville to jones street tnp QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv lines"
2018,Congestion,the congestion costs for these constraints more than doubled from $ QQltxlt100QQ million in QQyearlag1QQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million in QQyearQQ
2018,Congestion,this was due to recent transmission system additions enabling more export capability from the panhandle constraint
2018,Congestion,the increased exports from the panhandle led to more congestion in the dfw area
2018,Congestion,the retirement of five coal units at big brown and monticello in east texas also contributed to the increased congestion seen in this area
2018,Congestion,the panhandle constraint dropped from the most costly constraint in QQyearlag1QQ to third in QQyearQQ
2018,Congestion,"the panhandle constraint caused $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million of congestion in QQyearQQ , a QQmonthdayQQ % decrease from $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million in QQyearlag1QQ"
2018,Congestion,"by the end of QQyearQQ , there was almost QQmonthdayQQ gw of generation capacity in the panhandle area , QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of which was wind generation"
2018,Congestion,"the panhandle gtc limit ranged in value from 2,100 mw to 4,300 mw during QQyearQQ"
2018,Congestion,"the gtc limit average was 3,500 mw , up by QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw from 3,100 mw in QQyearlag1QQ , a QQmonthdayQQ % increase"
2018,Congestion,"this increase was attributable to the QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv installations and the two synchronous condensers , one located at alibates and the other at tule QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv substations in the panhandle"
2018,Congestion,"maintenance activity performed by ett on its transmission structures located in the panhandle continued to reduce the panhandle gtc limit , as work extended from QQyearlag1QQ into QQyearQQ"
2018,Congestion,ett continually monitors structures to find any additional damage and ett has been providing updates to the market participants via the outage scheduler and ad hoc congestion management working group meetings
2018,Congestion,"the average shadow price of the panhandle gtc during binding intervals was $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh , a $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh increase from QQyearlag1QQ , reflecting the difference between system - wide average price and negative prices from wind generation"
2018,Congestion,"the panhandle gtc was active for QQmonthdayQQ % of the time in QQyearQQ , down from QQmonthdayQQ % in QQyearlag1QQ"
2018,Congestion,congestion in the eagle mountain area between dallas and fort - worth was the fourth most costly constraint in QQyearQQ
2018,Congestion,"ercot’s QQyearlag1QQ regional transmission plan recommended transmission upgrades to this area to address the constraints of the wagley robertson to blue mound QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line , the wagley robertson to summerfield QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line , and the eagle mountain to morris dido QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line"
2018,Congestion,QQmonthdayQQ the same conditions that affected the lewisville area also affected the eagle mountain area

2018,Congestion,"the congestion related to this area was evident in the highest and seventh - highest valued constraints , yucca to basin QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line and the pig creek area"
2018,Congestion,the gas pad to basin QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line incurred $ QQmonthdayQQ million of its share of yucca to basin QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line constraint due to the shift in congestion from yucca to gas pad QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line after upgrades in the area were implemented
2018,Congestion,the upgrades were a result of an ercot board of directors approved project in QQmonthQQ QQyearlag2QQ brought forward by aep and oncor to address the increasing load due to oil and gas activity
2018,Congestion,"QQmonthdayQQ while the project initially targeted summer QQyearlead1QQ for completion , the yucca to gas pad QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv line portion of the transmission project was completed in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ"

2018,Congestion,the panhandle gtc incurred less congestion value in the day - ahead market than the real - time market as a result of less wind generation participating in the day - ahead market likely because of the uncertainty associated with predicting its output

2018,Congestion,the figure shows that this was not the case in some recent years
2018,Congestion,"in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , crr owners were paid less than the total cost paid to obtain them"
2018,Congestion,"in QQyearlag2QQ , it appears that crr owners made a small profit , but the cost to obtain the crrs reflects the discounted amounts that noies paid to obtain pcrrs"
2018,Congestion,"adding the noie discount to the auction revenue in QQyearlag2QQ would show crrs , in aggregate , to be unprofitable"
2018,Congestion,another item to note from these historical values is the relatively flat auction revenue
2018,Congestion,"while congestion rent and payments to crr owners has varied from less than $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million to more than $ QQmonthdayQQ billion per year , the costs paid to acquire crrs varied in a much narrower range between $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ and $ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ million per year since the start of the nodal market"
2018,Congestion,"this QQmonthQQ imply that aggregate crr profitability is less dependent on crr owners making acquisition decisions based on sophisticated analysis , and more likely driven by the vagaries of annual transmission congestion patterns"
2018,Congestion,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / transmission congestion and crrs figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : crr history $ 1,200 actual auction revenue payments to crr owners congestion rent $ 1,000 $ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ $ millions $ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ $ QQxlt1QQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ crr funding levels the target value of a crr is the megawatt amount of the crr multiplied by the locational marginal price ( lmp ) of the sink of the crr less the lmp of the source of the crr"
2018,Congestion,"while the target value is paid to crr account holders most of the time , there are two circumstances that cause ercot to pay less than the target value ( i.e"
2018,Congestion,", crrs are not fully funded )"
2018,Congestion,the first circumstance happens when the crr is modeled on the day - ahead network and causes a flow on a transmission line that exceeds the line’s limit
2018,Congestion,"in other words , the transmission capability assumed in the crr market is ultimately higher than in the day - ahead market , which can occur because of outages or other factors that reduce transfer capability"
2018,Congestion,"in this case , crrs with a positive value that have a source or a sink located at a resource node settlement point are paid a lower amount than the target value"
2018,Congestion,"the second circumstance occurs when there is not enough day - ahead congestion rent to pay all the crrs at target ( or derated , if applicable ) value"
2018,Congestion,"in this case , all holders of positively valued crrs receive a prorated shortfall charge such that the congestion revenue plus the shortfall charge can pay all crrs at target or derated value"
2018,Congestion,"this shortfall charge has the effect of lowering the net amount paid to crr account holders ; however , if at the end of the month there is excess day - ahead congestion rent that has not been paid out to crr account holders , the excess congestion rent can be used to make whole the crr account holders that received shortfall charges"
2018,Congestion,"if there is not enough excess congestion rent from the month , the rolling crr QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / transmission congestion and crrs balancing fund can be drawn upon to fully pay crr account holders that received shortfall charges"
2018,Congestion,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the crr balancing fund since the beginning of QQyearlag2QQ
2018,Congestion,"this year , due mostly to differences in the west load zone day - ahead and crr load distribution factors , the crr balancing fund was drawn on heavily in QQmonthQQ and depleted entirely in QQmonthQQ"
2018,Congestion,"while the balancing fund was once again up to its capped value of $ QQmonthdayQQ million by QQmonthQQ , another shortfall lowered the fund balance in QQmonthQQ"
2018,Congestion,at the end of the year the amount in the balancing fund was a little less than $ QQmonthdayQQ million
2018,Congestion,"in QQyearQQ , the total day - ahead surplus was $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million , significantly lower than the surplus of $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million in QQyearlag1QQ , due largely to the shortfalls in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ , and QQmonthQQ"
2018,Congestion,"because there was not enough day – ahead market surplus and crr balancing fund to fully refund the shortfall charge for the crr owners in QQmonthQQ , for the first time since the creation of the balancing account the balancing fund went to $ QQxlt1QQ and the crr owners received a shortfall charge , of $ QQmonthdayQQ million , of which only $ QQmonthdayQQ million was refunded at the end of QQmonthQQ"
2018,Congestion,"from the perspective of the load , even though there was a shortfall month , the monthly crr balancing account allocation to load was still a net positive in QQyearQQ and resulted in a total amount of $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ million at the end of the year"
2018,Congestion,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : crr balancing fund figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the amount of target payment , deration amount , and net shortfall charges ( after make whole payments ) for QQyearQQ"
2018,Congestion,"in QQyearQQ , the total target payment to crrs was $ 1,166 million ; however , there were $ QQltxlt100QQ million of derations and $ QQmonthdayQQ million of non - refunded shortfall charges QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / transmission congestion and crrs resulting in a final payment to crr account holders of $ 1,111 million"
2018,Congestion,"this final payment amount corresponds to a crr funding percentage of QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % , slightly lower than QQyearlag1QQ ’ QQmonthQQ funding percentage of QQ100ltxlt1kQQ %"

2018,Congestion,these price spreads are interesting as many loads QQmonthQQ have contracts that hedge to the hub price and are thus exposed to the price differential between the hub and its corresponding load zone
2018,Congestion,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ presents the price spreads between all hub and load zones as valued at four separate points in time – at the average of the four semi - annual crr auctions , monthly crr auction , day - ahead and real - time"
2018,Congestion,of note is the extreme divergence between the crr price spreads for the west load zone and the day - ahead and real - time price spreads
2018,Congestion,"the lagging nature of the crr revenues can be seen by steady growth of the west zone monthly crr spread from QQmonthQQ to QQmonthQQ , which continued one month after the day - ahead price spread dropped"
2018,Congestion,"the west load zone , due to the high congestion from QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ , had the highest hub to zone price spread in QQyearQQ , overtaking the south load zone"

2018,Supply/Demand,demand and supply this section reviews and analyzes the load patterns during QQyearQQ and the existing generating capacity available to satisfy the load and operating reserve requirements
2018,Supply/Demand,"specific analysis of the large quantity of installed wind generation is included , along with a discussion of the daily generation commitment characteristics"
2018,Supply/Demand,this section concludes with a review of the contributions from demand response resources
2018,Supply/Demand,a
2018,Supply/Demand,ercot load in QQyearQQ the changes in overall load levels from year to year can be shown by tracking the changes in average load levels
2018,Supply/Demand,this metric tends to capture changes in load over a large portion of the hours during the year
2018,Supply/Demand,separately evaluating the changes in the load during the highest - demand hours of the year is also important
2018,Supply/Demand,significant changes in peak demand levels play a major role in assessing the need for new resources
2018,Supply/Demand,the level of peak demand also affects the probability and frequency of shortage conditions ( i.e
2018,Supply/Demand,", conditions where firm load is served but minimum operating reserves are not maintained )"
2018,Supply/Demand,the expectation of resource adequacy is based on the value of electric service to customers and the harm or inconvenience to customers that can result from interruptions to that service
2018,Supply/Demand,"hence , both of these dimensions of load during QQyearQQ are examined in this subsection and summarized in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ"
2018,Supply/Demand,"this figure shows peak load and average load in each of the ercot geographic zones from QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ in each zone , as in most electrical systems , peak demand significantly exceeds average demand"
2018,Supply/Demand,the north zone is the largest zone ( with about QQltxlt100QQ % of the total ercot load ) ; the south and houston zones are comparable ( QQmonthdayQQ % ) while the west zone is the smallest ( QQmonthdayQQ % of the total ercot load )
2018,Supply/Demand,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ also shows the annual non - coincident peak load for each zone
2018,Supply/Demand,"this is the highest load that occurred in a particular zone for one hour during the year ; however , the peak can occur in different hours for different zones"
2018,Supply/Demand,"as a result , the sum of the non - coincident peaks for the zones is greater than the annual ercot peak load"
2018,Supply/Demand,"QQmonthdayQQ for purposes of this analysis , non - opt in entity ( noie ) load zones have been included with the proximate geographic zone"

2018,Supply/Demand,"this increase equates to approximately 2,200 mw per hour on average"
2018,Supply/Demand,all zones showed an increase in average real - time load in QQyearQQ ranging from QQmonthdayQQ % increase in houston to QQmonthdayQQ % increase in the west zone
2018,Supply/Demand,continuing robust oil and natural gas production activity in the west zone has been the driver for the high growth experienced recently
2018,Supply/Demand,weather impacts on load in QQyearQQ were mixed across the zones
2018,Supply/Demand,there were fewer annual cooling degree days across all zones
2018,Supply/Demand,"however , for the three summer months of QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ , there was a QQmonthdayQQ % increase from QQyearlag1QQ in the number of cooling degree days in dallas"
2018,Supply/Demand,"for the same time frame , austin had a QQmonthdayQQ % increase and houston was flat"
2018,Supply/Demand,"summer conditions in QQyearQQ produced a new record peak load of 73,473 mw on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ , surpassing the previous ercot - wide coincident peak hourly demand record of 71,110 mw set on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag2QQ"
2018,Supply/Demand,"a new winter peak demand record of 65,915 mw was also set on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ"
2018,Supply/Demand,"all zones experienced varying increases in peak load ranging from QQxlt1QQ % increase in houston to more than QQmonthdayQQ % increase in the west zone , which continued to experience the highest percentage growth in peak load , due to continuing growth in oil and natural gas production"
2018,Supply/Demand,"to provide a more detailed analysis of load at the hourly level , figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ compares load duration curves for each year from QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ"
2018,Supply/Demand,a load duration curve illustrates the number of hours ( shown on the horizontal axis ) that load exceeds a particular level ( shown on the vertical QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / demand and supply axis )
2018,Supply/Demand,"ercot has a fairly smooth load duration curve , typical of most electricity markets , with low to moderate electricity demand in most hours , and peak demand usually occurring during the late afternoon and early evening hours of days with exceptionally high temperatures"
2018,Supply/Demand,"the load duration curve in QQyearQQ was similar to QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearlag2QQ , though slightly higher"
2018,Supply/Demand,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : load duration curve – all hours frequency of demand > 60gw > 60gw > 50gw > 50gw > 40gw > 40gw QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQyearlag2QQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQyearlag1QQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQyearQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ load ( gw ) QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ QQmonthdayQQ QQmonthdayQQ QQxlt1QQ 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 hours to better illustrate the differences in the highest - demand periods between years , figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ below shows the load duration curve for the QQmonthdayQQ % of hours with the highest loads for the last three years"
2018,Supply/Demand,this figure also shows that the peak load in each year was significantly greater than the load at the 95th percentile of hourly load
2018,Supply/Demand,"since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , the peak load has averaged QQmonthdayQQ % to QQmonthdayQQ % greater than the load at the 95th percentile"

2018,Supply/Demand,the distribution of capacity among the four ercot geographic zones is similar to the distribution of demand with the exception of the large amount of wind capacity in the west
2018,Supply/Demand,"in QQyearQQ , the north zone accounted for approximately QQltxlt100QQ % of capacity , the south zone QQmonthdayQQ % , the houston zone QQmonthdayQQ % , and the west zone QQmonthdayQQ %"

2018,Supply/Demand,completion of the competitive renewable energy zones ( crez ) transmission lines has enabled more wind units to locate in the windier panhandle and also facilitate more output from wind units in the west
2018,Supply/Demand,"transmission maintenance for some QQ100ltxlt1kQQ kv transmission lines had the effect of limiting output from some of the resources in the panhandle , reducing their capacity factors"

2018,Supply/Demand,"even with the increased development activity in the coastal area of the south zone , QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of the wind resources in the ercot region are located in west texas"
2018,Supply/Demand,the wind profiles in this area are such that most of the wind production occurs during off - peak hours or other times of low system demand
2018,Supply/Demand,"these profiles result in only modest reductions of the net load relative to the actual load during the highest demand hours , but much larger reductions in the net load in the other hours of the year"
2018,Supply/Demand,"wind generation erodes the total load available to be served by base load coal units , while doing very little to reduce the amount of capacity necessary to reliably serve peak load"
2018,Supply/Demand,"in the hours with the highest net load ( left side of the figure below ) , the difference between peak net load and the 95th percentile of net load has averaged QQmonthdayQQ gw the past three years"

2018,Supply/Demand,this trend has put operational pressure on the almost QQmonthdayQQ gw of nuclear and coal generation that were in - service in QQyearQQ
2018,Supply/Demand,this operational pressure was certainly one of the contributors to the recent retirement of more than QQmonthdayQQ gw of coal in QQyearQQ
2018,Supply/Demand,"thus , although the peak net load and reserve margin requirements are projected to continue to increase and create an increasing need for non - wind capacity to satisfy ercot’s reliability QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / demand and supply requirements , the non - wind fleet can expect to operate for fewer hours as wind penetration increases"
2018,Supply/Demand,"this outlook further reinforces the importance of efficient energy pricing during peak demand conditions and other times of system stress , particularly in the context of the ercot energy - only market design"
2018,Supply/Demand,the growing numbers of solar generation facilities in ercot have an expected generation profile highly correlated with peak summer loads
2018,Supply/Demand,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ compares average summertime ( QQmonthQQ through QQmonthQQ ) hourly loads with observed output from solar resources , both in the west and central zones , as well as wind resources"
2018,Supply/Demand,generation output is expressed as a ratio of actual output divided by installed capacity
2018,Supply/Demand,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : summer renewable production this figure shows that solar production as a percentage of installed capacity is the highest in the early afternoon , approaching QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % for facilities located in the west and QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % for those in central texas , and producing almost QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % and QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % , respectively , of its installed capacity during peak load hours"
2018,Supply/Demand,"even though the amount of solar generation is currently much less than the amount of wind generation , large amounts of solar anticipated to be installed in ercot will be a large contributor to serving peak demand"
2018,Supply/Demand,the contrast between coastal wind and all other wind is also clearly displayed in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ
2018,Supply/Demand,coastal wind produced QQltxlt100QQ to QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of its installed capacity during summer peak hours

2018,Supply/Demand,demand response capability demand response is a term that broadly refers to actions that can be taken by end users of electricity to reduce load in response to instructions from ercot or in response to certain market or system conditions
2018,Supply/Demand,the ercot market allows participants with demand - response capability to provide energy and reserves in a manner similar to a generating resource
2018,Supply/Demand,the ercot protocols allow for loads to actively participate in the ercot - administered markets as load resources
2018,Supply/Demand,"a second way that loads QQmonthQQ participate is through ercot - dispatched reliability programs , including emergency response service ( ers ) and legislatively - mandated demand response programs administered by the transmission and distribution utilities in their energy efficiency programs"
2018,Supply/Demand,"additionally , loads QQmonthQQ self - dispatch by adjusting consumption in response to energy prices or by reducing consumption during specific hours to lower transmission charges"
2018,Supply/Demand,reserve markets ercot allows qualified load resources to offer responsive reserves into the day - ahead ancillary services markets
2018,Supply/Demand,tripping load has the effect of increasing system frequency and can be a very effective mechanism for maintaining system frequency at 60hz
2018,Supply/Demand,"load resources providing responsive reserves have high set under - frequency relay equipment , which enables the load to be automatically tripped when the system frequency falls below QQ100ltxlt1kQQ hz"
2018,Supply/Demand,these events typically occur only a few times each year
2018,Supply/Demand,"as of QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ , approximately 5,064 mw of qualified load resources were capable of providing responsive reserve service , an increase of approximately QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw during QQyearQQ"
2018,Supply/Demand,"on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , ercot began procuring a variable amount of responsive reserve service based on season and time of day"
2018,Supply/Demand,"ercot established equivalency ratios at this time , to better ascertain the amount of primary frequency response expected from the procurement of responsive reserves"
2018,Supply/Demand,"in QQyearlag2QQ , the first full year with variable procurement , the quantity of megawatts offered but not accepted by load resources increased"
2018,Supply/Demand,"during QQyearlag2QQ , there were no system - wide manual deployments of load resources providing responsive reserves"
2018,Supply/Demand,"there was , however , one automatic deployment of QQ1kltxlt1MQQ mw of frequency responsive load on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag2QQ"

2018,Supply/Demand,"the implementation of nprr815 allows load resources to now provide up to QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of the responsive reserve obligation , and also requires that at least 1,150 mw of responsive reserves be provided from generation resources"
2018,Supply/Demand,QQmonthdayQQ the quantity of load providing responsive reserve offers submitted exceeded the limit for most of QQyearQQ
2018,Supply/Demand,one exception is when real - time prices are expected to be high
2018,Supply/Demand,"because load resources provide capacity by reducing consumption , they have to be consuming energy to be eligible to provide the service"
2018,Supply/Demand,"during periods of expected high prices , for example brief periods in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ , the price paid for energy can exceed the value received from providing responsive reserves"
2018,Supply/Demand,reduced offer quantities observed during the spring and fall months QQmonthQQ reflect the lack of availability of load resources due to annual maintenance at some of the larger load resource facilities
2018,Supply/Demand,"ercot protocols also permit load resources to provide non - spinning reserves and regulation services , but for a variety of reasons , load resources have participated only minimally in providing these services"

2018,Supply/Demand,"QQmonthdayQQ the program was modified from a pay - as - bid auction to a clearing price auction in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , providing a clearer incentive to load to submit offers based on the costs to curtail , including opportunity cost"
2018,Supply/Demand,"in QQyearlag2QQ , the procurement for ers shifted from four time periods per contract term to six time periods per contract term"
2018,Supply/Demand,the additional time periods were created to separate the higher risk times of early morning and early evening from the overnight and weekend hours
2018,Supply/Demand,"the time and capacity - weighted average price for ers over the contract periods from QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ through QQmonthQQ QQyearlead1QQ was $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , similar to the outcome of $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh as the previous program year"
2018,Supply/Demand,"for the first time since the inception of the program , this price was lower than the average price of $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh paid for non - spinning reserves in QQyearQQ"
2018,Supply/Demand,the average price for non - spinning reserves in QQyearlag1QQ was much lower at $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh

2018,Supply/Demand,this response comes in two main forms
2018,Supply/Demand,the first is by participating in programs administered by competitive retailers or third parties to provide shared benefits of load reduction with end - use customers
2018,Supply/Demand,the second is through actions taken to avoid the allocation of transmission costs

2018,Supply/Demand,"this allocation mechanism is routinely referred to as four coincident peak , or 4cp"
2018,Supply/Demand,"by reducing demand during peak periods , load entities seek to reduce their share of transmission charges"
2018,Supply/Demand,"transmission costs have doubled since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , increasing an already substantial incentive to reduce load during probable peak intervals in the summer"
2018,Supply/Demand,"QQmonthdayQQ ercot estimates that as much as QQ1kltxlt1MQQ mw of load were actively pursuing reduction during the 4cp intervals in QQyearQQ , an increase of about QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw from QQyearlag1QQ voluntary load reductions to avoid transmission charges QQmonthQQ be distorting prices during peak demand periods because the response is targeting peak demand rather than responding to wholesale prices"
2018,Supply/Demand,"this was readily apparent in QQyearlag2QQ as there were significant load reductions corresponding to peak load days in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ when real - time prices on those days were in the range of $ QQmonthdayQQ to $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh"
2018,Supply/Demand,"the trend continued in QQyearlag1QQ , with significant reductions on peak load days in QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ when real - time prices were less than $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per mwh"

2018,Supply/Demand,two factors in the ercot market continue to advance appropriate pricing actions taken by load in the real - time energy market
2018,Supply/Demand,"first , the initial phase of “ loads in sced ” was implemented in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , allowing controllable loads that can respond to QQmonthdayQQ - minute dispatch instructions to specify the price at which they no longer wish to consume"

2018,Reliability,reliability commitments v
2018,Reliability,reliability commitments one of the important characteristics of any electricity market is the extent to which it results in the efficient commitment of generating resources
2018,Reliability,"under - commitment can cause apparent shortages in the real - time market and inefficiently high energy prices , while over - commitment can result in excessive start - up costs , uplift charges , and inefficiently low energy prices"
2018,Reliability,the ercot market does not include a mandatory centralized unit commitment process
2018,Reliability,the decision to start - up or shut - down a generator is made by the market participant
2018,Reliability,"ercot’s day - ahead market informs these decisions , but is only financially binding"
2018,Reliability,"that is , when a generator’s offer to sell is selected ( cleared ) in the day - ahead market there is no corresponding requirement to actually start that unit"
2018,Reliability,the generator will be financially responsible for providing the amount of capacity and energy cleared in the day - ahead market whether or not the unit operates
2018,Reliability,this decentralized commitment depends on clear price signals to ensure an efficient combination of units are online and available for dispatch
2018,Reliability,"ercot , in its role as reliability coordinator , has the responsibility to commit units it deems necessary to ensure the reliable operation of the grid"
2018,Reliability,"gaps exist between what individual resources , in aggregate , view as economic commitment and what ercot views as necessary to ensure the reliability of the region"

2018,Reliability,"this section describes the evolution of rules and procedures regarding reliability unit commitments ( ruc ) , and the outcomes of ruc activity in QQyearQQ"
2018,Reliability,it also describes the current operating plan data submitted by qualified scheduling entities ( qses ) and used by ercot to determine the need for a ruc
2018,Reliability,price mitigation that occurs during ruc and local congestion is described and the section concludes with a discussion of the reliability must run ( rmr ) process revisions in ercot in QQyearQQ
2018,Reliability,a
2018,Reliability,history of ruc - related protocol changes the ruc process has undergone several modifications since the nodal market began in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ
2018,Reliability,the following changes were implemented in an effort to improve the commitment process and market outcomes associated with ruc
2018,Reliability,"in QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , an offer floor was put in place for energy above the low - sustained limit ( lsl ) for units committed through ruc"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ initially , the ruc offer floor was set at the system - wide offer cap"
2018,Reliability,"the ruc offer floor was subsequently QQltxlt100QQ see nprr435 , requirements for energy offer curves in the real time sced for generation resources committed in ruc , implemented on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2018,Reliability,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / reliability commitments adjusted to $ 1,000 per mwh35 and then to the current offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh"
2018,Reliability,QQltxlt100QQ resources committed through the ruc process receive a make - whole payment and forfeit market revenues through a “ clawback ” provision
2018,Reliability,"beginning on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , resources committed through the ruc process could forfeit the make - whole payments and waive the clawback charges , effectively self - committing and accepting the market risks associated with that decision"
2018,Reliability,QQltxlt100QQ this buyback or “ opt - out ” mechanism for ruc initially required a resource to update its current operating plan ( cop ) before the close of the adjustment period for the first hour of a ruc
2018,Reliability,"on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , ercot automated the ruc offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh and implemented the real - time on - line reliability deployment adder ( reliability adder )"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ ercot systems now automatically set the energy offer floor at $ 1,500 per mwh when a resource properly telemeters a status indicating it has received a ruc instruction"
2018,Reliability,"the reliability adder , as discussed more in section i : review of real - time market outcomes , captures the impact of reliability deployments such as ruc on energy prices"
2018,Reliability,the ruc process was modified again in QQyearlag1QQ
2018,Reliability,"on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag1QQ , ercot began using a telemetered snapshot at the start of each ruc instruction block as the trigger to calculate the reliability adder"
2018,Reliability,"this was an improvement over the previous calculation trigger , which required the qse to accurately telemeter an onruc status"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ resources now have the ability to opt - out of ruc instructions after the close of the adjustment period , because the opt - out decision is no longer communicated via the cop"
2018,Reliability,resources are also now permitted to opt out of ruc instructions via real - time telemetry ; opting out of a ruc instruction is available for resources that telemeter onoptout during the first dispatchable interval within the first ruc - hour of the commitment block instruction
2018,Reliability,"during QQyearQQ , approximately QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of ruc instructions were given after the close of the adjustment period compared to QQmonthdayQQ % of instructions issued after the close of the adjustment period in QQyearlag1QQ"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ nprr568 , real - time reserve price adder based on operating reserve demand curve , implemented on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ nprr626 , reliability deployment price adder , partially - implemented to update the ruc offer floor on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ nprr416 , creation of the ruc resource buyback provision ( formerly “ removal of the ruc clawback charge for resources other than rmr units ” ) , as modified by nprr575 , clarification of the ruc resource buy - back provision for ancillary services"

2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ nprr744 , ruc trigger for the reliability deployment price adder and alignment with ruc settlement , implemented on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlag1QQ"
2018,Reliability,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / reliability commitments the most significant change to the ruc process in QQyearQQ was the approval and implementation of nprr864 , ruc modifications to consider market - based solutions , which modified the ruc engine to consider fast - start generators ( start time of QQmonthdayQQ hour or less ) as self - committed for future hours"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ the culmination of these ruc changes has enabled ercot to defer supplementary commitment decisions , allowing market participants full opportunity to make their own unit commitment several other proposed protocol revisions were initiated in QQyearQQ , including a board - approved modification that will allow ercot systems to adjust the configuration of a self - committed combined cycle unit , to increase available capacity"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ further , market participants considered a proposal in QQyearQQ that would address the situation of a qse receiving a ruc instruction for a unit that had received a dam award but electing to not actually operate"
2018,Reliability,in this situation the resource should not receive ruc settlement treatment
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ and finally , market participants also began considering a proposal to address the settlement of switchable generation resources receiving an instruction to switch from a non - ercot control area to the ercot control area"

2018,Reliability,"ruc outcomes ercot continually assesses the adequacy of market participants ’ resource commitment decisions using the ruc process , which executes both on a day - ahead and hour - ahead basis"
2018,Reliability,"additional resources QQmonthQQ be determined to be needed for two reasons – to satisfy the total forecasted demand , or to make a specific generator available resolve a transmission constraint"
2018,Reliability,the transmission constraint QQmonthQQ be either a thermal limit or a voltage concern
2018,Reliability,the number of ruc instructions in QQyearQQ increased somewhat from QQyearlag1QQ
2018,Reliability,the QQ1kltxlt1MQQ unit - hours of ruc instructions in QQyearQQ represent a QQmonthdayQQ % increase from the QQ1kltxlt1MQQ unit - hours in QQyearlag1QQ
2018,Reliability,"these QQyearQQ ruc instructions were geographically diverse as well , with QQmonthdayQQ % to generators in the south zone in a variety of locations : san antonio , corpus christi , and the rio grande valley , QQmonthdayQQ % were to generators in the houston zone , QQmonthdayQQ % were to generators in the north zone , and the remaining QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % were to generators in the west zone"
2018,Reliability,"as in QQyearlag1QQ , most reliability commitments in QQyearQQ were made primarily to manage transmission constraints ( QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of unit - hours )"
2018,Reliability,"only QQmonthdayQQ % of ruc instructions were made to ensure sufficient QQltxlt100QQ nprr864 , ruc modifications to consider market - based solutions , implemented on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ ; see also nprr875 , clarification for the implementation of nprr864 , ruc modifications to consider market - based solutions"
2018,Reliability,"QQltxlt100QQ nprr884 , adjustments to pricing and settlement for reliability unit commitments ( rucs ) of on - line combined cycle generation resources , approved on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ"

2018,Reliability,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / reliability commitments system - wide capacity and QQmonthdayQQ % were for voltage support
2018,Reliability,most of the ruc instructions in QQyearQQ occurred during a single month
2018,Reliability,"congestion in the permian basin area of west texas related to higher than expected load , planned and forced outages led to QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unit - hours of ruc instructions during QQmonthQQ"
2018,Reliability,"ruc activity in previous years has been the result of specific , typically short - term system needs"
2018,Reliability,looking back at the primary drivers for ruc activity in previous years no single or long - standing cause is apparent
2018,Reliability,"in QQyearlag1QQ , construction of the houston transmission import project and the necessity to maintain stability during outages immediately following hurricane harvey in QQyearlag1QQ were primary drivers"
2018,Reliability,the high amount of ruc activity in QQyearlag2QQ was due to localized transmission congestion for units located in houston and the valley
2018,Reliability,"in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , rucs were most frequent in the fall because of congestion in dallas and the valley"
2018,Reliability,ruc activity in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ was concentrated during cold weather events in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ and in response to transmission outages in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ
2018,Reliability,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ below shows ruc activity by month for QQyearlag2QQ through QQyearQQ , indicating the volume of generators receiving a ruc instruction that had offers in the day - ahead market or chose to opt - out of the ruc instruction"

2018,Reliability,"however , if the energy payments received by a unit operating under a ruc instruction exceed its operating costs , payment to that generator is reduced ( ruc clawback charge )"
2018,Reliability,"generators without offers submitted to the day - ahead market forfeit all excess revenues , whereas generators with day - ahead offers forfeit only QQltxlt100QQ % of excess revenues"
2018,Reliability,"given this incentive to have offers submitted in the day - ahead market , it is somewhat surprising that all units do not submit day - ahead offers"
2018,Reliability,"in QQyearQQ , only QQmonthdayQQ % of the total ruc unit - hours had day - ahead offers"
2018,Reliability,"this is lower than expected , considering the incentive to provide day - ahead offers inherent in the ruc claw - back rules"
2018,Reliability,"the percentage of ruc unit - hours with day - ahead offers was much higher in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearlag2QQ at QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % and QQltxlt100QQ % , respectively"
2018,Reliability,"the very low value in QQyearQQ QQmonthQQ be explained by the large number of fast starting generators receiving ruc instructions , primarily during QQmonthQQ due to higher than expected load , planned and forced outages"
2018,Reliability,"sixty percent of the unit - hour instructions in QQyearQQ were for fast starting generators , whereas , since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ a more typical share has been QQmonthdayQQ %"
2018,Reliability,it is not unusual for the decision to commit fast starting units to be made in real - time
2018,Reliability,"since QQmonthQQ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , a generator receiving a ruc instruction has had the choice to “ opt out , ” meaning it forgoes all ruc make - whole payments in return for not being subject to ruc clawback charges"
2018,Reliability,"the percentage of generators receiving ruc instructions in QQyearQQ that chose to opt - out was QQmonthdayQQ % , similar to the QQmonthdayQQ % of generators that chose to opt - out in QQyearlag1QQ"
2018,Reliability,there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ hours in which units were settled as ruc in QQyearQQ
2018,Reliability,the amount of time with non - zero reliability adders was much less ( QQ100ltxlt1kQQ hours )
2018,Reliability,"there were QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unit - hours of ruc instructions to ensure system - wide adequacy in QQyearQQ , representing QQmonthdayQQ % of the total ruc - hour instructions"
2018,Reliability,"this is an increase from QQ100ltxlt1kQQ unit - hours in QQyearlag1QQ ( QQmonthdayQQ % of the total ) and , QQltxlt100QQ unit - hours ( QQmonthdayQQ % of the total ) in QQyearlag2QQ"
2018,Reliability,the increased occurrence of ruc instructions for system - wide adequacy is not unexpected given ercot’s decreasing levels of reserve capacity

2018,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows that the monthly average dispatch of units receiving ruc instructions has rarely been close to the average high capacity limit
2018,Reliability,"this figure shows that the average quantity dispatched exceeded QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw only six months in QQyearQQ , and that no ruc activity occurred in QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ"
2018,Reliability,in QQmonthQQ the average dispatch level was more than QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw because of mitigation of the onruc resource
2018,Reliability,"the other months of QQmonthQQ , QQmonthQQ , and QQmonthQQ were close to QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw due to ruc resources choosing to opt - out and thus not having a $ QQ1kltxlt1MQQ per mwh offer floor"
2018,Reliability,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / reliability commitments figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : reliability unit commitment capacity units committed for ruc in QQyearQQ showed a slight decrease in the dispatch level compared to prior years
2018,Reliability,"in QQmonthdayQQ % of intervals with ruc resources , one or more resources were dispatched above their low dispatchable limit ( ldl ) , whereas in prior years , resources receiving a ruc were infrequently dispatched above ldl"
2018,Reliability,"this higher dispatch level indicates that most units receive ruc instructions to resolve local constraints , and that these local constraints are non - competitive"
2018,Reliability,"as a result , units are paid based on their mitigated offer caps"
2018,Reliability,"it is rare for a generator receiving a ruc instruction to be dispatched above ldl with its offer at or above the $ 1,500 per mwh offer floor"
2018,Reliability,"in QQyearQQ , this occurred in only QQmonthdayQQ % of the intervals with an onruc resource"
2018,Reliability,"when a unit is committed for ruc , the unit will receive a make - whole payment if the real - time revenues received are less than the costs incurred to commit the unit"
2018,Reliability,these costs can be based on generic values or unit - specific verifiable costs

2018,Reliability,ruc make - whole payments in QQyearQQ were collected almost exclusively from qses that were capacity short
2018,Reliability,the amount of make - whole that was uplifted was de minimis

2018,Reliability,qse operation planning one of the important characteristics of any electricity market is the extent to which it results in the efficient commitment of generating resources
2018,Reliability,"under - commitment can cause shortages in the real - time market and inefficiently high energy prices ; while over - commitment can result in excessive start - up costs , uplift charges , and inefficiently low energy prices"
2018,Reliability,the cop is the mechanism used by qses to communicate the expected status of their resources to ercot
2018,Reliability,"after aggregating cop information about the amount of capacity that qses expect to be on line every hour , ercot then evaluates any potential locational or system - wide capacity deficiency"
2018,Reliability,"if such a deficiency is identified , ercot will issue a ruc instruction to ameliorate the shortfall"
2018,Reliability,the accuracy of cop information greatly affects ercot’s ability to effectively perform supplemental commitment using the ruc process
2018,Reliability,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / reliability commitments cops are updated an ongoing basis by qses , providing multiple views of their expectations for a particular operating hour"
2018,Reliability,"presumably , qse expectations about which units will be online in a particular hour are most accurate for the cop submitted just before the operating hour"
2018,Reliability,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the average difference between the actual online unit capacity in the peak hour and the amount of capacity planned to be online in the peak hour as submitted each of the QQmonthdayQQ hours leading up to the close of the adjustment period
2018,Reliability,"this data is derived from cop submissions and averaged for hour ending QQmonthdayQQ in the months of QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ , for each year QQ1kltxlt1MQQ through QQyearQQ"
2018,Reliability,the figure shows that the amount of capacity needed to serve peak load has increasingly been committed in the final hour
2018,Reliability,"in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ about QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw of capacity was committed in the last hour before real - time , and in QQyearlag2QQ , the amount increased to more than QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw , with even larger deficiencies seen in the hours leading up to real - time"
2018,Reliability,the increase in self - committed capacity seen during QQyearlag1QQ QQmonthQQ have been a reaction to the increased ruc activity observed in QQyearlag2QQ
2018,Reliability,however nearly 400mw remained to be committed in the last hour during QQyearlag1QQ
2018,Reliability,"in QQyearQQ , the average amount of capacity committed in the last hour exceeded QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw"
2018,Reliability,"compared to the average load of QQ100ltxlt1kQQ gw in hour QQmonthdayQQ , the amount of last minute self - commitment is just less than one percent of total capacity needs"
2018,Reliability,"as previously described , only a small portion of total ruc instructions were issued to ensure system - wide capacity sufficiency"
2018,Reliability,this is testament to the restraint exhibited by ercot operators to allow market participants to make their own commitment decisions with regard to the nearly QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw of close - to real - time capacity commitments
2018,Reliability,"the fact that there is nearly 5,000 mw of fast starting generators controlled by multiple market participants highlights the complexity of these decisions and suggests that improvements to these close - to - real - time commitments QQmonthQQ be warranted"

2018,Reliability,"multiple cop submissions provide data for each of the hours being evaluated , and there can be large variations in unit commitment expectations reflected in those multiple cops , even for the same operating hour"
2018,Reliability,"because unit commitment decisions for renewable resources are influenced by much different factors than other types of resources , the first analysis focuses only on renewable resources"

2018,Reliability,"mitigation in situations where competitive forces are not sufficient , it is necessary to mitigate prices to a level that approximates competitive outcomes"
2018,Reliability,ercot’s real - time market includes a mechanism to mitigate prices for resources that are required to resolve a transmission constraint
2018,Reliability,mitigation applies whether the unit is self - committed or receives a ruc instruction
2018,Reliability,"units typically receive a ruc instruction to resolve transmission constraints and as such are typically required to resolve a transmission constraint , and therefore mitigated"
2018,Reliability,"as shown previously in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ , units that received a ruc instruction were frequently dispatched above their low operating limits in QQyearQQ"
2018,Reliability,"this higher dispatch was most often the result of the ruc units being dispatched based on their mitigated price , not based on the ruc offer floor of $ 1,500 per mwh"
2018,Reliability,"ercot’s dispatch software includes an automatic , two - step price mitigation process"
2018,Reliability,"in the first step , the dispatch software calculates output levels ( base points ) and associated locational marginal prices using the participants ’ offer curves and considers only the transmission constraints that have been deemed competitive"
2018,Reliability,"these “ reference prices ” at each generator location are compared with that generator’s mitigated offer cap , and the higher of the two is used to formulate the offer curve to be used for that generator in the second step in the dispatch process"
2018,Reliability,"the resulting mitigated offer curve is used by the dispatch software to determine the final output levels for each generator , taking all transmission constraints into consideration"
2018,Reliability,this approach is intended to limit the ability of a generator to raise prices in the event of a transmission constraint that requires its output to resolve

2018,Resource Adequacy,resource adequacy one of the primary functions of the wholesale electricity market is to provide economic signals that will facilitate the investment needed to maintain a set of resources that are adequate to satisfy the system’s needs
2018,Resource Adequacy,this section begins with an evaluation of these economic signals by estimating the “ net revenue ” resources received from ercot real - time and ancillary services markets and providing comparisons to other markets
2018,Resource Adequacy,"next , the effectiveness of the scarcity pricing mechanism is reviewed"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the current estimate of planning reserve margins for ercot are presented , followed by a description of the factors necessary to ensure resource adequacy in an energy - only market design"
2018,Resource Adequacy,a
2018,Resource Adequacy,net revenue analysis net revenue is calculated by determining the total revenue that could have been earned by a generating unit less its variable production costs
2018,Resource Adequacy,"put another way , it is the revenue in excess of short - run operating costs that is available to recover a unit’s fixed and capital costs , including a return on the investment"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in ercot’s energy - only market , the net revenues from the real - time energy and ancillary services markets alone provide the economic signals that inform suppliers ’ decisions to invest in new generation or retire existing generation"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"to the extent that revenues are available through the day - ahead market or other forward bilateral contract markets , these revenues are ultimately derived from the expected real - time energy and ancillary service prices"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"although most suppliers are likely to receive the bulk of their revenues through bilateral contracts , the spot prices produced in the real - time energy market should drive bilateral energy prices over time and thus are appropriate to use for this evaluation"
2018,Resource Adequacy,it is important to note that this net revenue calculation is a look back at the estimated contribution based on actual market outcomes
2018,Resource Adequacy,suppliers will typically base investment decisions on expectations of future electricity prices
2018,Resource Adequacy,"although expectations of future prices should be informed by history , they will also factor in the likelihood of shortage pricing conditions that could be very different than what actually occurred"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the energy net revenues are computed based on the generation - weighted settlement point prices from the real - time energy market
2018,Resource Adequacy,"weighting the energy values in this way facilitates comparisons between geographic zones , but will mask what could be very high values for a specific generator location"
2018,Resource Adequacy,this analysis does not consider any payments for potential ruc actions
2018,Resource Adequacy,the analysis relies on simplifying assumptions that can lead to over - estimates of the profitability of operating in the wholesale market
2018,Resource Adequacy,start - up costs and minimum running times are not accounted for in the net revenue analysis
2018,Resource Adequacy,"ramping restrictions , which can prevent generators from profiting during brief price spikes , are also excluded"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"but despite these limitations , the net revenue analysis provides a useful summary of signals for investment in the wholesale market"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy for purposes of this analysis , the following assumptions were used for natural gas units : heat rates of QQmonthdayQQ mmbtu per mwh for a combined cycle unit , QQmonthdayQQ mmbtu per mwh for a combustion turbine , and $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in variable operating and maintenance costs"
2018,Resource Adequacy,a total outage rate ( planned and forced ) of QQmonthdayQQ % was assumed for each technology
2018,Resource Adequacy,net revenue is calculated by assuming the unit will produce energy in any hour for which it is profitable and by assuming it will be available to sell reserves and regulation ( combined cycle units only ) in all other hours
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the next two figures provide an historical perspective of the net revenues available to support investment in a new natural gas combustion turbine ( figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ) and combined cycle generation ( figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ) , selected to represent the marginal new supply that QQmonthQQ enter when new resources are needed"
2018,Resource Adequacy,values for the west zone are excluded because historically lower energy prices make it a less attractive location to site natural gas generation
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the figure also shows the estimated “ cost of new entry , ” which represents the revenues needed to break even on the investment"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : combustion turbine net revenues based on estimates of investment costs for new units , the net revenue required to satisfy the annual fixed costs ( including capital carrying costs ) of a new combustion turbine unit ranges from $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"although higher overall in QQyearQQ than any year since QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , the ercot market continued to provide net revenues well below the level needed to support new investment , ranging from below $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year in the north zone to more than $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year in houston"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / resource adequacy figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : combined cycle net revenues for a new combined cycle natural gas unit , the estimate of net revenue requirement is approximately $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the net revenues in QQyearQQ for a new combined cycle unit were calculated to be approximately $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per kw - year , depending on the zone"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"again , these values are well below the estimated cost of new combined cycle generation"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"these results are consistent with a shrinking surplus of capacity , which contributed to more frequent shortages in QQyearQQ compared to recent years"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in an energy - only market , shortages play a key role in delivering the net revenues an investor needs to recover its investment"
2018,Resource Adequacy,such shortages will tend to be clustered in years with unusually high load or poor generator availability
2018,Resource Adequacy,the results in QQyearQQ do not by themselves raise substantial concern regarding design or operation of ercot’s operating reserve demand curve ( ordc ) mechanism for pricing shortages
2018,Resource Adequacy,"given the recent generation retirements and continued load growth , QQyearQQ was in fact a year with significantly more occurrences of shortage pricing , with that trend expected to continue in QQyearlead1QQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,a new trend evident in QQyearQQ was the growing separation in natural gas prices between the waha and houston locations
2018,Resource Adequacy,"increased drilling activity in the permian basin of far west texas has produced a glut of natural gas and consequently , much lower prices at the waha location"
2018,Resource Adequacy,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ below provides a comparison of net revenue for both types of natural gas units assuming houston and waha gas prices
2018,Resource Adequacy,"with waha gas prices , the net revenues of gas units located in the west zone are higher than the other locations"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"even though the load price in the west is higher QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy than the corresponding prices in the other three zones , the generation weighted settlement point price in the west is much lower"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : west zone net revenues QQ100ltxlt1kQQ waha gas price QQ100ltxlt1kQQ houston ship channel gas price QQ100ltxlt1kQQ net revenues ( $ / kw ‐ year ) QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ QQmonthdayQQ QQmonthdayQQ QQmonthdayQQ QQxlt1QQ combined cycle combustion combined cycle combustion turbine turbine QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ given the continuing effects of relatively low natural gas prices , the economic viability of existing coal and nuclear units was evaluated"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"non - shortage prices , which have been substantially affected by the prevailing natural gas prices , determine the vast majority of net revenues received by these base load units"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"as previously described , the load - weighted ercot - wide average energy price in QQyearQQ was $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the generation - weighted average price for the four nuclear units in ercot ( approximately QQmonthdayQQ gw of capacity ) was lower at $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh
2018,Resource Adequacy,"according to data published by the nuclear energy institute , the total generating cost for nuclear energy in the u.s"
2018,Resource Adequacy,was $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ the generation - weighted average price in QQyearlag1QQ for the four nuclear units in ercot was less than $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh
2018,Resource Adequacy,assuming that operating costs in ercot are similar to the u.s
2018,Resource Adequacy,"average , and that nuclear operating costs have either continued their multi - year decline or held stable in QQyearQQ , it is likely that the nuclear units in ercot are marginally profitable"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"unlike other regions with large amounts of nuclear generation , the four nuclear units in ercot are relatively new and owned by QQ100ltxlt1kQQ https : / / www.nei.org / resources / reports - briefs / nuclear - costs - in - context QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / resource adequacy four entities with sizable load obligations"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"even if these units are not profitable on a stand - alone basis , the nuclear units have substantial option value for the owners because they ensure that their cost of serving their load will not rise substantially if natural gas prices increase"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"with the apparent reduction in nuclear operating costs , the economic pressure on these units seems to be easing"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the generation - weighted price of all coal and lignite units in ercot during QQyearQQ was $ QQltxlt100QQ per mwh , an increase from $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh in QQyearlag1QQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"although specific unit costs QQmonthQQ vary , index prices for powder river basin coal delivered to ercot were approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu in QQyearQQ ; remaining at QQyearlag1QQ ( and QQ1kltxlt1MQQ ) levels after decreasing to $ QQmonthdayQQ per mmbtu in QQyearlag2QQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,at these average prices coal units in ercot are likely receiving just enough revenue to cover operating costs
2018,Resource Adequacy,"during QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and QQyearlag2QQ , delivered coal costs in ercot were higher than natural gas prices at the houston ship channel , resulting in reduced market share for coal generation"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"with the increased natural gas prices in QQyearlag1QQ and QQyearQQ , the spread between coal and natural gas increased to nearly $ QQxlt1QQ per mmbtu"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"however , given coal units generally have higher heat rates and more expensive non - fuel ( QQmonthQQ & QQmonthQQ ) costs than combined - cycle natural gas units , economic pressure remain for coal units"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"luminant retired seven coal units in early QQyearQQ , cps energy retired two coal units at the end of the year"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ additionally , texas municipal power authority also announced the continued mothballing of the gibbons creek coal unit late in the year"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the imm reviewed each of these actions and found them to be supported by the unit specific financials
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ monticello units QQmonthdayQQ , QQmonthdayQQ , and QQmonthdayQQ , totaling 1,865 mw , retired on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ ; sandow units QQmonthdayQQ and QQmonthdayQQ , totaling approximately 1,200 mw , retired on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ ; and big brown units QQmonthdayQQ and QQmonthdayQQ , totaling 1,208 mw , retired on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ"

2018,Resource Adequacy,"this is evident in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ which compares the net revenues for gas generation ( combustion turbine and combined cycle ) located in the houston zone paying houston ship channel gas prices , with the same technologies located in the west zone and paying waha natural gas prices"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"although higher than in other locations , net revenues for generators in the west were not sufficient to support new build in QQyearQQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the current low natural gas prices at waha are a result of the apparent high profitability of oil production in the permian basin
2018,Resource Adequacy,natural gas is produced as an associated product and there is insufficient transport capacity for the current amounts of natural gas being produced
2018,Resource Adequacy,new transportation projects have been identified and are currently being worked
2018,Resource Adequacy,"however , it is unclear how much longer the large basis difference in natural gas prices will continue to exist"
2018,Resource Adequacy,also shown in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ are the net revenues for wind and solar generation at multiple locations
2018,Resource Adequacy,"as the cost to install wind or solar does not vary much by location , the profitability of those resources are chiefly determined by the available natural resource and the prevailing price to be received"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"for both wind and solar generators , profitability in QQyearQQ appears to have been QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / resource adequacy inversely related to the available natural resource"
2018,Resource Adequacy,net revenues for wind and solar in some locations were equal to gas technologies in QQyearQQ
2018,Resource Adequacy,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : net revenues by generation resource type QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ net revenues ( $ / kw ‐ year ) QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ QQmonthdayQQ QQmonthdayQQ QQmonthdayQQ QQxlt1QQ houston west houston west south west coast others panhandle combustion turbine combined cycle solar wind these results indicate that during QQyearQQ , the ercot markets would not have provided sufficient revenues to support profitable investment in any of the types of generation technology evaluated"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"as detailed in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ , very little non - renewable capacity was added in QQyearQQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,this seems inconsistent with the increased levels of scarcity pricing present in the ercot market in QQyearQQ compared to recent years
2018,Resource Adequacy,there continues to be robust investment in renewable generation additions
2018,Resource Adequacy,it is unclear how much of that is in anticipation of the expiration of federal tax credits and how much will continue in the long term
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the backward - looking net revenue analysis provides insight into the potential profitability of new generation , and therefore the ability of the ercot market to attract sufficient new resources to meet growing customer demands for electricity"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"however , resource investment decisions are driven by multiple factors"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"first , resource investments are driven primarily by forward price expectations"
2018,Resource Adequacy,historical net revenue analyses do not provide a view of the future pricing expectations that will spur new investment
2018,Resource Adequacy,"suppliers will develop their own view of future expected revenue and given the level to which prices will rise under shortage conditions , small differences in expectations about the frequency of shortage pricing can greatly influence revenue expectations"
2018,Resource Adequacy,real - time prices in QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy the summer of QQyearQQ did not reach the expectations as set by forward prices
2018,Resource Adequacy,"forward prices for summer of QQyearlead1QQ are currently lower than they were at a similar time for QQyearQQ , even though the installed capacity margins are smaller"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"second , this analysis does not account for bilateral contracts"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the only revenues considered in the net revenue calculation are those that came directly from the ercot real - time energy and ancillary services markets in a specific year
2018,Resource Adequacy,some developers QQmonthQQ have bilateral contracts for unit output that would provide more revenue than the ercot market did in QQyearQQ
2018,Resource Adequacy,"given the level to which prices will rise under shortage conditions , buyers QQmonthQQ enter bilateral contracts to hedge against high shortage pricing"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"third , net revenues in any one year QQmonthQQ be higher or lower than an investor would require over the long term"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in QQyearQQ , shortages were more common than in recent years , but still much less frequent than would be expected over the long term"
2018,Resource Adequacy,shortage revenues play a pivotal role in motivating investment in an energy - only market like ercot
2018,Resource Adequacy,"hence , in some years shortage pricing will be frequent and net revenues QQmonthQQ substantially exceed the cost of entry , while in most others it will be less frequent and net revenue will be less than the cost of entry"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"finally , the costs of new entry used in this report are generic for the u.s"
2018,Resource Adequacy,and reflective of the costs of a new unit on an undeveloped greenfield site
2018,Resource Adequacy,they have been reduced somewhat to reflect the lower costs of construction in texas
2018,Resource Adequacy,"however , companies QQmonthQQ have opportunities to build generation at much lower cost than these estimates ; either by having access to lower cost equipment , or by adding the new unit to an existing site , or some combination of both"
2018,Resource Adequacy,financing structures and costs can vary greatly between suppliers and QQmonthQQ be improved to be lower than the generic financing costs assumed in the net revenue analysis
2018,Resource Adequacy,"to provide additional context for the net revenue results presented in this subsection , the net revenue in the ercot market for two types of natural gas generation technologies are compared with the net revenue that those technologies could expect in other wholesale markets"

2018,Resource Adequacy,"ercot does not have a capacity market , and thus , does not have any net revenue from capacity sales"

2018,Resource Adequacy,the exception to this trend was miso’s tx zone
2018,Resource Adequacy,"most other markets also have sufficient installed reserves , typically a result of low or no load growth"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the two figures also show that capacity revenues in nyiso and pjm provide a meaningful portion of the net revenues for new resources
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in ercot , these revenues will be provided through its shortage pricing , which is evaluated in the next section"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"because shortage pricing has not been frequent in the past two years , the net revenues in ercot have tended to be lower than those in rto areas with functional capacity markets despite the fact that ercots capacity margin is much lower than any of the other markets shown"

2018,Resource Adequacy,effectiveness of the scarcity pricing mechanism the commission adopted rules in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ that define the parameters of an energy - only market
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in accordance with the imm’s charge to conduct an annual review , QQ100ltxlt1kQQ this subsection assesses the scarcity pricing mechanism ( spm ) in QQyearQQ under ercot’s energy - only market structure"
2018,Resource Adequacy,revisions to QQmonthdayQQ tac § QQmonthdayQQ were adopted in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ that specified a series of increases to the ercot system - wide offer cap
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the last step went into effect on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , increasing the system - wide offer cap to $ 9,000 per mwh"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"as shown in figure QQmonthdayQQ on page QQmonthdayQQ , there have been very brief periods when energy prices rose to the cap since the system - wide offer cap was QQ100ltxlt1kQQ see QQmonthdayQQ tac § QQmonthdayQQ ( g ) ( QQmonthdayQQ ) ( QQmonthQQ )"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / resource adequacy increased to greater than $ 3,000 per mwh , with prices hitting $ 9,000 for the first time on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the spm includes a provision termed the peaker net margin ( pnm ) that is designed to provide a fail - safe pricing measure , which if exceeded would cause the system - wide offer cap to be reduced"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"if the pnm for a year reaches a cumulative total of $ 315,000 per mw , the system - wide offer cap is then reduced to the higher of $ 2,000 per mwh or QQltxlt100QQ times the daily natural gas price index"
2018,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ pnm also serves as a simplified measure of the annual net revenue of a hypothetical peaking unit
2018,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ market outcomes in QQyearQQ indicate that net revenues provided by the ercot real - time market were not at a level sufficient to support new natural - gas fueled generation
2018,Resource Adequacy,it appears that market outcomes in QQyearQQ were reflective of the specific conditions experienced rather than any flaw with the scarcity pricing mechanism
2018,Resource Adequacy,"ercot’s energy - only market design is intended to produce very high energy prices ( including the operating reserve adder ) during times of supply scarcity , i.e"
2018,Resource Adequacy,", when available capacity is insufficient to meet both total demand for electricity and required operating reserves"
2018,Resource Adequacy,this structure creates a very strong incentive for generators to be available at the times when they are expected to be needed most
2018,Resource Adequacy,the benefits from the incentives for generator availability in ercot’s energy - only market design are somewhat thwarted by the lack of a priced - based mechanism to determine when to convert reserve capacity into energy in real - time
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in an energy - only market that depends on scarcity pricing signals to provide incentive for proper levels of investment , it is imperative the scarcity pricing reflects actual scarcity rather than the inefficient assignment of reserve capacity"
2018,Resource Adequacy,real - time co - optimization will improve the accuracy of the shortage pricing mechanism
2018,Resource Adequacy,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the cumulative pnm results for each year since the creating of the scarcity pricing mechanism and shows that pnm in QQyearQQ was higher than in recent years , but still not approaching the levels reached in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"considering the purpose of pnm was initially defined to provide a “ circuit breaker ” trigger for lowering the system - wide offer cap , pnm has not approached levels that would dictate a needed reduction in the system wide offer cap , even in a relatively high year like QQyearQQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the threshold established in the initial rule was $ 300,000 per mw - year"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"for QQ1kltxlt1MQQ and each subsequent year , ercot shall set the pnm threshold at three times the cost of new entry of new generation plants"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the current threshold is based on the most recent version of an other binding document entitled “ system - wide offer cap and scarcity pricing mechanism methodology

2018,Resource Adequacy,concerns with the spm under the zonal market design were addressed in every state of the market report produced during that period
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the implementation of the nodal market design , which included a power balance penalty curve , created the opportunity for real - time energy prices to systematically reflect the value of reduced reliability imposed under shortage conditions , regardless of submitted offers"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , the commission took another step toward improving resource adequacy signals by directing ercot to implement the ordc"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"as discussed in section i : review of real - time market outcomes , ordc is a shortage pricing mechanism that reflects the loss of load probability at varying levels of operating reserves multiplied by the value of lost load"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in the short time it has been in effect , ordc has had a modest impact on real - time prices , even in QQyearQQ when reduced installed reserves led to higher expectations of shortage pricing"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in the spring of QQyearQQ , a change to the ordc was implemented at the behest of the commission via other binding document revision request ( obdrr ) QQmonthdayQQ , which modified the methodology for implementing operating reserve demand curve ( ordc ) to calculate real - time reserve QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the zonal market design was not the problem per se , rather its reliance on high - priced offers to set high prices during periods of shortage was of concern"
2018,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / resource adequacy price adder
2018,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ this obdrr revised the on - line and off - line capacity reserves for resources on - line during a reliability unit commitment ( ruc ) instruction
2018,Resource Adequacy,"with this change , onruc capacity is now excluded from the reserves used to determine the ordc price adder , increasing the value of the ordc price adder and resulting in potentially higher real - time energy prices"
2018,Resource Adequacy,this was a relatively minor change to the ordc implemented prior to the summer of QQyearQQ in order to improve pricing signals under tight conditions
2018,Resource Adequacy,a more profound change to the ordc was contemplated by the commission in the latter half of QQyearQQ when reviewing summer market performance
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the commission considered proposals modifying various defining aspects of the curves used to determine the ordc price adder including shifting the loss of load probability ( lolp ) portion of the curve , as well as modifying the minimum contingency level ( “ x ” ) and the value of lost load ( voll )"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the lolp portion of the curves used to determine the ordc price adder has typically been constructed using normal probability distributions which are defined by two factors , mu and sigma"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"for each of the twenty - four curves currently used ( six time of day blocks and four seasons ) , these factors are calculated by taking the average of historical differences between expected and actual operating reserves ( “ mu ” ) and the standard deviation in those values ( “ sigma ” )"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the commission deliberated the merits of these proposed ordc changes , as well as implementation of marginal losses and real - time co - optimization , through the close of QQyearQQ regardless of the ordc parameter values , the fact that responsive and regulating reserves are forced to be maintained ( held behind the high ancillary service limit ( hasl ) ) under the current market design will continue to be problematic until real - time co - optimization is implemented"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"by not allowing reserves to be converting to energy at any price , reserves will not gradually decrease , which means that prices will not gradually increase"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"reserves will be sufficient until they are not , which means that the contribution from the operating reserve adder will be relatively small until reserves are deficient and the contribution from the adder is quite large"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"jointly optimizing all products will improve the utilization of ercot resources , ensure that shortage pricing only occurs when the system is actually short after fully utilizing its resources , and establish prices for each product that efficiently reflect its reliability value without the use of administrative caps and adders"

2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / resource adequacy developed in QQmonthQQ 2018,63 due in large part to higher expected seasonal peak loads , additional delays and cancellations of planned projects , and the indefinite mothballing of QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw at the gibbons creek coal unit"
2018,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the reserve margin is expected to continue to be below existing target levels for the foreseeable future
2018,Resource Adequacy,installed reserve margins for summer of QQyearQQ were also historically low
2018,Resource Adequacy,what seem like very low reserves QQmonthQQ just be the new normal
2018,Resource Adequacy,"given the overall size of the system and projected growth , a more robust reserve margin QQmonthQQ no longer be required to cover load forecast errors and mitigate generator availability risks"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"for example , a QQmonthdayQQ % reserve margin for a QQltxlt100QQ gw system would provide QQmonthdayQQ gw of installed reserves , whereas for a QQ100ltxlt1kQQ gw system the installed reserves would be QQmonthdayQQ gw"
2018,Resource Adequacy,it is not clear that the magnitude of forecasting errors are directly proportional to the size of peak load
2018,Resource Adequacy,"further , the size of generators has not increased and there are more of them , which means generator availability risks are proportionally smaller"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"with smaller , more distributed generation technologies playing an increasingly important role in ercot , the risk associated with generator outages should decrease"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearQQ , ercot filed a draft report with the commission titled "" estimation of the market equilibrium and economically optimal reserve margins for the ercot region"
2018,Resource Adequacy,""" QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the report estimates the market equilibrium reserve margin ( merm ) and economically optimal reserve margin ( eorm ) for ercot's wholesale electric market with projected system conditions for QQ1kltxlt1MQQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in the draft report , the brattle group ( brattle ) estimated a merm of QQmonthdayQQ % under projected QQ1kltxlt1MQQ market conditions"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"brattle further estimated the eorm as QQmonthdayQQ % , based on the risk - neutral , probability - weighted - average cost of 57,000 simulations"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the draft report stated that estimated societal costs are relatively flat with respect to reserve margin near the minimum , with only modest variation between reserve margins of QQmonthdayQQ % and QQmonthdayQQ %"
2018,Resource Adequacy,brattle stated that the economic optimum occurs at the reserve margin that minimizes societal costs net of all supply costs and the lost value from any disruptions in electric service

2018,Resource Adequacy,QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy stated that its analysis shows that the market equilibrium of QQmonthdayQQ % is greater than the economically optimal level of capacity by QQmonthdayQQ %
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ this current projection of planning reserve margins is consistent with the economic signals produced by the market in recent years , which are themselves the product of the sustained capacity surpluses that have existed in ercot"
2018,Resource Adequacy,hence these results demonstrate that the market is functioning properly
2018,Resource Adequacy,"less efficient , uneconomic units are retiring in times of relatively low prices"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"of the eleven generation units retired or mothballed since the QQmonthQQ QQyearlag1QQ cdr , eight of those units ( totaling approximately 4,500 mw ) were coal units"
2018,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the imm views the decisions to retire the coal units to be justified based on the operating history and estimated costs of continued operations
2018,Resource Adequacy,"similar to the forces that have led to the retirement of less efficient natural gas fueled steam units , the retirement of older , less efficient coal units is an expected market outcome"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the retirement of uneconomic generation should not be viewed as failure to provide resource adequacy
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in fact , facilitating efficient decisions by generators to retire uneconomic units is nearly as important as facilitating efficient decisions to invest in new resources"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"with expectations for future natural gas prices to remain relatively low , the economic pressure on coal units in ercot is not expected to subside any time soon"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"aep publicly announced in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ that the QQ1kltxlt1MQQ mw oklaunion coal unit will retire by QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlead2QQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the plant is located on the texas side of the border between the two states and feeds power into the southwest power pool ( spp ) and ercot , and accounts for QQmonthdayQQ % of ercot’s summer coal capacity"
2018,Resource Adequacy,its retirement would leave ercot with QQmonthdayQQ operational coal units
2018,Resource Adequacy,the effects of this proposed retirement have not been factored in to current projections because aep has not formally filed a notice to suspend operations with ercot
2018,Resource Adequacy,"even with low prices , there continues to be high interest in the ercot market from generation developers as evidenced by the amount of capacity under consideration for interconnection"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"at the end of QQyearQQ , there was more capacity in the various stages of interconnection evaluation than at the beginning of the year"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"however , the composition of that capacity had changed with much more solar and wind generation and reduced amounts of natural gas generation"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"because the surplus has now disappeared and shortages are likely to be even more frequent in QQyearlead1QQ , the economic signals could change rapidly"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"these short - term market outcomes and price signals , as well as investors ’ response to these economic signals , will be monitored"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"this QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ercot posted an updated version of the report on QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ , QQyearlead1QQ"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the revised report ( http : / / www.ercot.com / content / wcm / lists / QQ1kltxlt1MQQ / 2018_12_20_ercot_merm_report_final.pdf ) does not materially differ from the previous version

2018,Resource Adequacy,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / resource adequacy response could cause the planning reserve margins to exceed the forecast shown in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ above
2018,Resource Adequacy,QQmonthQQ
2018,Resource Adequacy,"ensuring resource adequacy one of the primary goals of an efficient and effective electricity market is to ensure that , over the long term , there is an adequate supply of resources to meet customer demand plus any required installed or planning reserves"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in a region like ercot , where customer requirements for electricity have been and are expected to continue to increase , even with growing demand response efforts , maintaining adequate supply requires capacity additions"
2018,Resource Adequacy,to incent these additions the market design must provide revenues such that the marginal resource receives revenues sufficient to make that resource economic
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in this context , “ economic ” includes both a return of and on capital investment"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"generators earn revenues from three sources : energy prices during non - shortage , energy prices during shortage and capacity payments"
2018,Resource Adequacy,the capacity payments generators receive in ercot are related to the provision of ancillary services
2018,Resource Adequacy,"ancillary service payments are a small contributor to generator revenues , approximately $ QQmonthdayQQ per kw - year"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"setting ancillary service payments aside , generator revenue in ercot is overwhelmingly derived from energy prices under both shortage and non - shortage conditions"
2018,Resource Adequacy,bilateral contracts should be priced based on expectations for these values
2018,Resource Adequacy,"if real - time prices are expected to be $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh , it would not be reasonable to contract to sell at a price much below that level , or inversely , contract to buy at a price far above that value"
2018,Resource Adequacy,energy pricing under non - shortage conditions should be the same regardless of whether payments for capacity exist
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in ercot , with no capacity payments available , the amount a generator QQmonthQQ receive from energy pricing under shortage conditions must be large enough to provide the necessary incentives for new capacity additions"
2018,Resource Adequacy,this will occur when energy prices are allowed to rise substantially during times when the available supply is insufficient to simultaneously meet both energy and minimum operating reserve requirements
2018,Resource Adequacy,"ideally , energy and reserve prices during shortages should reflect the diminished system reliability under these conditions , which is equal to the increased probability of “ losing ” ( not serving ) load times the value of the lost load"
2018,Resource Adequacy,allowing energy prices to rise during shortages mirrors the outcome expected if loads were able to actively specify the quantity of electricity they wanted and the price they would be willing to pay
2018,Resource Adequacy,"the energy - only market design relies exclusively on these relatively infrequent occurrences of high prices to provide the appropriate price signal for demand response and new investment , when required"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"in this way , energy - only markets can provide price signals that will sustain a portfolio of resources to be used in real - time to satisfy the needs of the system"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"however , this portfolio QQmonthQQ not include enough capacity to meet a specified target quantity of planning reserves"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / resource adequacy faced with reduced levels of generation development activity coupled with increasing loads that resulted in falling planning reserve margins , the commission has devoted considerable effort deliberating issues related to resource adequacy"
2018,Resource Adequacy,"over the long term , a co - optimized energy and operating reserve market will provide more accurate shortage pricing"
2018,Resource Adequacy,planning reserves should continue to be monitored to determine whether shortage pricing alone is leading to the desired level of planning reserves

2018,Analysis,competitive performance vii
2018,Analysis,"analysis of competitive performance in this section , market power is evaluated from two perspectives : structural ( does market power exist ) and behavioral ( have attempts been made to exercise it )"
2018,Analysis,market structure is examined by using a pivotal supplier analysis that indicates the frequency with which a supplier was pivotal at higher load levels
2018,Analysis,this section also includes a summary of the voluntary mitigation plans in effect during QQyearQQ
2018,Analysis,market participant conduct is evaluated by reviewing measures of physical and economic withholding
2018,Analysis,these withholding patterns are further examined relative to the level of demand and the size of each supplier’s portfolio
2018,Analysis,"based on these analyses , we find the overall performance of the ercot wholesale market to be competitive in QQyearQQ"
2018,Analysis,a
2018,Analysis,structural market power indicators the market structure is analyzed by using the residual demand index ( rdi )
2018,Analysis,"the rdi is used to measure the percentage of load that cannot be served without the resources of the largest supplier , assuming that the market could call upon all committed and quick - start capacity owned by other suppliers"
2018,Analysis,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ when the rdi is greater than zero , the largest supplier is pivotal ( i.e"
2018,Analysis,", its resources are needed to satisfy the market demand )"
2018,Analysis,"when the rdi is less than zero , no single supplier’s resources are required to serve the load if the resources of its competitors are available"
2018,Analysis,"the rdi is a useful structural indicator of potential market power , but it is important to recognize its limitations"
2018,Analysis,"as a structural indicator , the rdi does not illuminate actual supplier behavior to indicate whether a supplier QQmonthQQ have exercised market power , or whether it would have been profitable for a pivotal supplier to exercise market power"
2018,Analysis,"nonetheless , the rdi does identify conditions under which a supplier could raise prices significantly by withholding resources"
2018,Analysis,"figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the ramp - constrained rdi , calculated at the qse level , relative to load for all hours in QQyearQQ"
2018,Analysis,the occurrences of a pivotal supplier are not limited to just the high load summer period
2018,Analysis,this analysis indicated the existence of a pivotal supplier for some fraction of time at load levels as low as QQltxlt100QQ gw
2018,Analysis,the trend line indicates a strong positive relationship between load and the rdi
2018,Analysis,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ for the purpose of this analysis , “ quick - start ” includes off - line combustion turbines that are flagged as on - line in the current operating plan with a planned generation level of QQxlt1QQ mw that ercot has identified as capable of starting - up and reaching full output after receiving a dispatch instruction from the real - time energy market"

2018,Analysis,"this is expected because at high load levels , the largest suppliers are more likely to be pivotal as other suppliers ’ resources are more fully utilized serving the load"
2018,Analysis,"pivotal suppliers existed QQmonthdayQQ % of all hours in QQyearQQ , which was more frequent than in QQyearlag1QQ when pivotal suppliers existed in QQmonthdayQQ % of all hours"
2018,Analysis,the increase was due to the greater number of high load ( > 65gw ) hours in QQyearQQ
2018,Analysis,"over the past several years , as generation supply ownership in ercot has become less concentrated , the fraction of time with a pivotal supplier has decreased from QQ100ltxlt1kQQ - QQ100ltxlt1kQQ % of the time down to QQmonthdayQQ - QQmonthdayQQ % seen in recent years"
2018,Analysis,"even with this reduction , market power continues to be a potential concern in ercot , requiring effective mitigation measures to address it"
2018,Analysis,inferences regarding market power cannot be made solely from pivotal supplier data
2018,Analysis,bilateral and other financial contract obligations can affect a supplier’s potential market power
2018,Analysis,"for example , a small supplier selling energy only in the real - time energy market QQmonthQQ have a much greater incentive to exercise market power than a large supplier with substantial long - term sales contracts"
2018,Analysis,"the rdi measure shown in the previous figures does not consider the contractual position of the supplier , which can increase a supplier’s incentive to exercise market power compared to the load - adjusted capacity assumption made in this analysis"
2018,Analysis,it should be noted that the analysis above evaluates the structure of the entire ercot market
2018,Analysis,"in general , local market power in narrower areas that can become isolated by transmission constraints raise more substantial competitive concerns"
2018,Analysis,"as more fully discussed in section v , reliability commitments , this local market power is addressed through : ( a ) structural tests that determine “ non - competitive ” constraints that can create local market power ; and ( b ) the application of limits on offer prices in these areas"
2018,Analysis,voluntary mitigation plans voluntary mitigation plans ( vmps ) existed for four market participants at various times in QQyearQQ
2018,Analysis,generation owners are motivated to enter into vmps because adherence to a plan approved by the commission constitutes an absolute defense against an allegation of market power abuse through economic withholding with respect to behaviors addressed by the plan
2018,Analysis,this increased regulatory certainty afforded to a generation owner regarding its energy offers in the ercot real - time market must be balanced by appropriate protections against a potential abuse of market power in violation of pura § QQltxlt100QQ ( a ) and QQmonthdayQQ tac § QQmonthdayQQ ( g ) ( QQmonthdayQQ )
2018,Analysis,vmps should promote competitive outcomes and prevent abuse of market power through economic withholding in the ercot real - time energy market
2018,Analysis,the same restrictions are not required in forward energy markets ( e.g
2018,Analysis,", the ercot day - ahead market ) because the prices in forward energy markets are derived from expectations for real - time energy prices"
2018,Analysis,"because forward energy markets are voluntary and the market rules do not inhibit arbitrage between the forward energy markets and the real - time energy market , competitive outcomes in the real - time QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / competitive performance energy market serve to discipline the potential abuse of market power in the forward energy markets"
2018,Analysis,"by the end of QQyearQQ , only calpine and nrg had active and approved vmps"
2018,Analysis,"luminant terminated its previously - approved vmp in QQyearQQ , while exelon’s was terminated automatically , for the reasons outlined below"
2018,Analysis,"calpine’s vmp was approved in QQmonthQQ of QQ1kltxlt1MQQ because its generation fleet consists entirely of natural gas fueled combined cycle units , the details of the calpine plan are somewhat different than the others"
2018,Analysis,calpine QQmonthQQ offer up to QQmonthdayQQ % of the dispatchable capacity of its portfolio at prices up to $ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ per mwh
2018,Analysis,"additionally , calpine QQmonthQQ offer up to QQmonthdayQQ % of the dispatchable capacity of its portfolio at prices no higher than the system - wide offer cap"
2018,Analysis,"when approved , the amount of capacity covered by these provisions was approximately QQ100ltxlt1kQQ mw"

2018,Analysis,"the approved vmps QQmonthQQ be terminated by the executive director of the commission with three business days ’ notice , subject to ratification by the commission"
2018,Analysis,"pura defines market power abuses as “ practices by persons possessing market power that are unreasonably discriminatory or tend to unreasonably restrict , impair , or reduce the level of competition"
2018,Analysis,"” QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the exercise of market power QQmonthQQ not rise to the level of an abuse of market power if the actions in question do not unreasonably impair competition , which would typically involve profitably raising prices significantly above the competitive level for a significant period of time"
2018,Analysis,"thus , although the offer thresholds provided in the vmps are designed to promote competitive market outcomes , the short termination provision provides additional assurance that any unintended consequences associated with the potential exercise of market power can be addressed in a timely manner rather than persisting and rising to the level of an abuse of market power"
2018,Analysis,b
2018,Analysis,evaluation of supplier conduct the previous subsection presented a structural analysis that supports inferences about potential market power
2018,Analysis,this subsection provides the results of evaluating actual participant conduct to assess whether market participants have attempted to exercise market power through physical or economic withholding
2018,Analysis,"first , unit deratings and forced outages are examined to detect physical withholding"
2018,Analysis,"this is followed by an evaluation of the “ output gap , ” used to detect economic withholding"
2018,Analysis,"in a single - price auction like the real - time energy market , suppliers QQmonthQQ attempt to exercise market power by withholding resources"
2018,Analysis,"the purpose of withholding is to cause more expensive resources to set higher market clearing prices , allowing the supplier to profit on its other sales in the real - time energy market"
2018,Analysis,"because forward prices will generally be highly correlated with spot prices , price increases in the real - time energy market can also increase a supplier’s profits in the bilateral energy market"
2018,Analysis,this strategy is profitable only if the withholding firm’s incremental profit as a result of higher price is greater than the lost profit from the foregone sales of its withheld capacity
2018,Analysis,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ pura § QQltxlt100QQ ( a )
2018,Analysis,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / competitive performance generation outages and deratings at any given time , some portion of installed capacity is unavailable because of generator outages and deratings"
2018,Analysis,"because of limitations in outage data , the outage type must be inferred"
2018,Analysis,the outage type can be inferred by cross - referencing unit status information communicated to ercot with scheduled outage submissions
2018,Analysis,"if there is a corresponding scheduled outage , the unit is considered to be on a planned outage"
2018,Analysis,"if not , it is considered to be a forced outage"
2018,Analysis,the derated capacity is defined as the difference between the summertime maximum capacity of a generating resource and its actual capability as communicated to ercot on a continuous basis
2018,Analysis,it is very common for generating capacity to be partially derated because the resource cannot achieve its installed capacity level because of technical or environmental factors ( e.g
2018,Analysis,", component equipment failures or ambient temperature conditions )"
2018,Analysis,wind generators rarely produce at the installed capacity rating because of variations in available wind input
2018,Analysis,because such a large portion of derated capacity is related to wind generation it is shown separately in the following evaluation of long - term and short - term deratings
2018,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows a breakdown of total installed capacity for ercot on a daily basis during QQyearQQ
2018,Analysis,this analysis includes all in - service and switchable capacity
2018,Analysis,from the total installed capacity the following are subtracted : ( a ) capacity from private networks not available for export to the ercot grid ; ( b ) wind capacity not available because of the lack of wind input ; ( c ) short - term deratings ; ( QQmonthQQ ) short - term planned outages ; ( e ) short - term forced outages ; and ( e ) long - term outages and deratings greater than QQmonthdayQQ days
2018,Analysis,what remains is the capacity available to serve load
2018,Analysis,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / competitive performance figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : reductions in installed capacity QQ100ltxlt1kQQ installed capacity QQ100ltxlt1kQQ private network capacity not available for export to the ercot grid generation capacity ( gw ) QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQltxlt100QQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ short term derating short term forced outage short term planned outage long term unavailable unavailable wind capacity available to serve load short - term outages and deratings of non - wind generators fluctuated between QQmonthdayQQ and QQmonthdayQQ gw , as shown in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ , while wind unavailability varied between QQmonthdayQQ and QQmonthdayQQ gw"
2018,Analysis,"short - term planned outages were largest in the shoulder months of QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ , while smallest during the summer months , consistent with expectations"
2018,Analysis,"short - term forced outages and deratings had no discernable seasonal pattern , occurring throughout the year , also consistent with expectations"
2018,Analysis,"the quantity of long - term ( greater than QQmonthdayQQ days ) unavailable capacity , peaked in QQmonthQQ at more than QQmonthdayQQ gw , with almost all capacity returned to service in anticipation of tighter conditions during the summer of QQyearQQ"
2018,Analysis,the next analysis focuses specifically on short - term planned outages and forced outages and deratings of non - wind units because these classes of outages and deratings are the most likely to be used to physically withhold units in an attempt to raise prices
2018,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the average magnitude of the outages and deratings lasting less than QQmonthdayQQ days for the year and for each month during QQyearQQ
2018,Analysis,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / competitive performance figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : short - term outages and deratings QQmonthdayQQ % deratings planned outages QQmonthdayQQ % forced outages QQmonthdayQQ % percentage of capacity QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQxlt1QQ % QQyearlag2QQ QQyearlag1QQ QQyearQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows that total short - term deratings and outages were almost QQmonthdayQQ % of installed capacity in QQmonthQQ and dropped to less than QQmonthdayQQ % during QQmonthQQ and QQmonthQQ
2018,Analysis,most of this fluctuation was due to planned outages
2018,Analysis,"the amount of capacity unavailable during QQyearQQ averaged QQmonthdayQQ % of installed capacity , a slight decrease from QQmonthdayQQ % experienced in QQyearlag1QQ and QQmonthdayQQ % in QQyearlag2QQ"
2018,Analysis,the amount of planned outages was noticeably higher in QQyearQQ
2018,Analysis,this QQmonthQQ be explained by the heightened expectations for shortages during the summer and generators taking outage time to ensure higher availability
2018,Analysis,the decrease in the amount of deratings QQmonthQQ also be similarly explained by generators operating in modes that would allow them to maximize generation
2018,Analysis,the following figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ provides a comparison of the monthly outage and derating values for QQyearQQ and QQyearlag1QQ
2018,Analysis,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / competitive performance figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : derating , planned outages and forced outages QQmonthdayQQ % QQyearQQ deratings QQyearQQ planned outages QQyearQQ forced outages QQyearlag1QQ deratings QQyearlag1QQ planned outages QQyearlag1QQ forced outages QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % percentage of capacity QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQxlt1QQ % QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ QQmonthQQ it shows the consistency of forced outages , with the interesting exception of lower forced outages in QQmonthQQ QQyearQQ followed by a higher forced outage rate in QQmonthQQ"
2018,Analysis,this pattern would seem to imply that generator operators were able to somehow defer the impacts of unexpected equipment limitations through QQmonthQQ
2018,Analysis,"however , those actions QQmonthQQ have come at the cost of higher outage rates in QQmonthQQ"
2018,Analysis,the significant increase in planned outages scheduled during spring and fall QQyearQQ QQmonthQQ be an indicator of intense preparation for what was expected to be a summer with very tight operating conditions
2018,Analysis,the large reduction in deratings across all months of QQyearQQ would also seem to indicate that generators were intent on making every bit of capability available to the market
2018,Analysis,"it is unclear as to whether the low outage rates during QQmonthQQ and the low level of derations were a direct result of increased planned maintence activities , or merely good fortune"
2018,Analysis,evaluation of potential physical withholding physical withholding occurs when a participant makes resources unavailable for dispatch that are otherwise physically capable of providing energy and that are economic at prevailing market prices
2018,Analysis,a plant operator can withhold by either by derating a unit or declaring the unit as forced out of service
2018,Analysis,"because generator deratings and forced outages are unavoidable , the goal of the analysis in this subsection is to differentiate justifiable deratings and outages from physical withholding"
2018,Analysis,physical withholding is tested for by examining deratings and outage data to QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / competitive performance ascertain whether the data are correlated with conditions under which physical withholding would likely be most profitable
2018,Analysis,the rdi results shown in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ and figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ indicate that the potential for market power abuse rises at higher load levels as the frequency of positive rdi values increases
2018,Analysis,"hence , if physical withholding is occurring , one would expect to see increased deratings and outages at the highest load levels"
2018,Analysis,"conversely , because competitive prices increase as load increases , deratings and outages in a market performing competitively will tend to decrease as load approaches peak levels"
2018,Analysis,suppliers that lack market power will take actions to maximize the availability of their resources because their output is generally most profitable in peak periods
2018,Analysis,figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ shows the average relationship of short - term deratings and forced outages as a percentage of total installed capacity to real - time load levels for large and small suppliers during summer months
2018,Analysis,portfolio size is important in determining whether individual suppliers have incentives to withhold available resources
2018,Analysis,"hence , the patterns of outages and deratings of large suppliers can be usefully evaluated by comparing them to the small suppliers ’ patterns"
2018,Analysis,long - term deratings are not included in this analysis because they are unlikely to constitute physical withholding given the cost of such withholding
2018,Analysis,wind and private network resources are also excluded from this analysis because of the high variation in the availability of these classes of resources
2018,Analysis,the large supplier category includes the five largest suppliers in ercot
2018,Analysis,the small supplier category includes the remaining suppliers
2018,Analysis,"QQyearQQ state of the market report | QQ100ltxlt1kQQ / competitive performance figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ : outages and deratings by load level and participant size , QQmonthQQ - QQmonthQQ QQmonthdayQQ % deratings planned outages QQmonthdayQQ % forced outages QQmonthdayQQ % percentage of capacity QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQmonthdayQQ % QQxlt1QQ % large large large large large large large small small small small small small small QQltxlt100QQ ‐ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ ‐ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ ‐ QQltxlt100QQ QQltxlt100QQ ‐ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ‐ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ ‐ QQ100ltxlt1kQQ > QQ100ltxlt1kQQ load level ( gw ) figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ suggests that as demand for electricity increases , all market participants tend to make more capacity available to the market by scheduling planned outages during low load periods"
2018,Analysis,"because small participants have less incentive to physically withhold capacity , the outage rates for small suppliers serves as a good benchmark for competitive behavior expected from the larger suppliers"
2018,Analysis,"outage rates for large suppliers at all load levels exceeded those for small suppliers , but are not at levels that raise competitiveness concerns"
2018,Analysis,outages rates for small suppliers were historically low in QQyearQQ
2018,Analysis,"small suppliers have the most incentive to ensure generator availability because each unit in their fleet makes up a larger percentage of the total , which means that any outage has the potential for larger financial impacts"
2018,Analysis,"again , it is not clear whether the low outage rates seen in QQyearQQ were the result of improved scheduled maintence procedures , or merely good fortune"
2018,Analysis,"evaluation of potential economic withholding to complement the prior analysis of physical withholding , this subsection evaluates potential economic withholding by calculating an “ output gap"
2018,Analysis,” the output gap is the quantity of energy that is not being produced by online resources even though the output is economic to produce by a substantial margin given the real - time energy price
2018,Analysis,"a participant can economically withhold resources , as measured by the output gap , by raising its energy offers so as not to be dispatched"
2018,Analysis,a resource is evaluated for inclusion in the output gap when it is committed and producing at less than full output
2018,Analysis,energy not produced from a committed resource is included in the output QQ100ltxlt1kQQ | QQyearQQ state of the market report / competitive performance gap if the real - time energy price exceeds that unit’s mitigated offer cap by at least $ QQmonthdayQQ per mwh
2018,Analysis,QQ100ltxlt1kQQ the mitigated offer cap serves as a proxy for the marginal production cost of energy from that resource
2018,Analysis,"before presenting the results of the output gap analysis , a description of ercot’s two - step dispatch software is required"
2018,Analysis,"in the first step , the dispatch software calculates output levels ( base points ) and associated locational marginal prices using the participants ’ offer curves and only considering transmission constraints that have been deemed competitive"
2018,Analysis,"these “ reference prices ” at each generator location are compared with the generator’s mitigated offer cap , and the higher of the two is used to formulate the offer curve for that generator during the second step in the dispatch process"
2018,Analysis,"the resulting mitigated offer curve is used by the dispatch software to determine the final output levels for each generator , taking all transmission constraints into consideration"
2018,Analysis,"if a market participant has sufficient market power , it might raise its offer in such a way to increase the reference price in the first step"
2018,Analysis,"although in the second step the offer appears to be mitigated , the market participant has still influenced the market price"
2018,Analysis,this output gap is measured by the difference between the capacity level on a generator’s original offer curve at the first step reference price and the capacity level on the generator’s cost curve at the first step reference price
2018,Analysis,"however , this output gap is only indicative because no output instructions are sent based on the first step"
2018,Analysis,the output gap is only used to screen whether a market participant is withholding in a manner that QQmonthQQ influence the reference price
2018,Analysis,the results of the analysis shown below in figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ indicate that only very small amounts of capacity would be considered part of the first step output gap
2018,Analysis,the amount of capacity shown reflects the average for only the intervals in which an output gap was detected
2018,Analysis,if averaged over all intervals the amounts are de minimis
2018,Analysis,"QQ100ltxlt1kQQ prior to QQ1kltxlt1MQQ , the state of the market report used $ QQltxlt100QQ for the output gap margin"
2018,Analysis,"with the reduction in average prices , the gap was reduced"

2018,Analysis,"in the second step of the dispatch , the after - mitigation offer curve is used to determine dispatch instructions and locational prices"
2018,Analysis,"as previously illustrated , even though the offer curve is mitigated , there is still the potential for the mitigated offer curve to be increased"
2018,Analysis,this increase would be the result of a high first - step reference price being influenced by a market participant raising prices
2018,Analysis,the percentage of a step QQmonthdayQQ output gap hours evident in QQyearQQ was QQmonthdayQQ %
2018,Analysis,"similar to the previous analysis , figure QQ100ltxlt1kQQ also shows very small quantities of capacity that would be considered part of this output gap , with only QQmonthdayQQ % of the hours in QQyearQQ that exhibited an output gap"

2018,Analysis,output gaps of the largest suppliers are routinely monitored individually and were found to be consistently low across all load levels
